1,Real-Time Illegal Parking Detection in Outdoor Environments Using 1-D Transformation,"With decreasing costs of high-quality surveillance systems, human activity detection and tracking has become increasingly practical. Accordingly, automated systems have been designed for numerous detection tasks, but the task of detecting illegally parked vehicles has been left largely to the human operators of surveillance systems. We propose a methodology for detecting this event in real time by applying a novel image projection that reduces the dimensionality of the data and, thus, reduces the computational complexity of the segmentation and tracking processes. After event detection, we invert the transformation to recover the original appearance of the vehicle and to allow for further processing that may require 2-D data. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm using the i-LIDS vehicle detection challenge datasets as well as videos we have taken ourselves. These videos test the algorithm in a variety of outdoor conditions, including nighttime video and instances of sudden changes in weather.",05-Jun
2,Real-Time Illegal Parking Detection System Based on Deep Learning,"The increasing illegal parking has become more and more serious. Nowadays the methods of detecting illegally parked vehicles are based on background segmentation. However, this method is weakly robust and sensitive to environment. Benefitting from deep learning, this paper proposes a novel illegal vehicle parking detection system. Illegal vehicles captured by camera are firstly located and classified by the famous Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) algorithm. To improve the performance, we propose to optimize SSD by adjusting the aspect ratio of default box to accommodate with our dataset better. After that, a tracking and analysis of movement is adopted to judge the illegal vehicles in the region of interest (ROI). Experiments show that the system can achieve a 99% accuracy and real-time (25FPS) detection with strong robustness in complex environments.",05-Jul

4,Illegal Parking Detection Using Gaussian Mixture Model and Kalman Filter,"Automatic analysis of videos for traffic monitoring has been an area of significant research in the recent past. In this paper, we proposed a system to detect and track illegal vehicle parking using Gaussian Mixture Model and Kalman Filter. i-LIDS dataset is used to test and evaluate the algorithm by comparing the results with the ground truth provided, we have tested the system using 4 full videos from i-LIDS to detect parked vehicle whiten specific area. Region of interest has been used to detect Vehicle parks in a no parking zone over sixty seconds and remains stationary.

5,A Deep Learning based Illegal Parking Detection Platform,"Illegal parking is a critical problem in large, growing cities. Currently, the responsibility for detecting illegally parked vehicles has been left to law enforcement, which often requires manual inspection. To improve the efficiency of law enforcement for vehicle parking management, we propose a web-based analytic platform that leverages recent advancements in computer vision. This proposed platform provides an algorithm to improve the performance of detecting vehicle license plates from videos, based on an existing deep learning approach. Also, we provide a method to estimate vehicle parking locations. This platform is applicable for videos of security patrolling. End-users can define restricted zones via a map-based interface and all vehicles located in these areas can be efficiently identified once patrolling videos are received. This system is evaluated by two videos captured in real-world parking lots. The results indicate that the proposed platform can successfully identify vehicle plate numbers and estimate their parking locations to support the management of urban parking infrastructure.",05-Jul
6,Detection and recognition algorithm of illegal parking,"To overcome the shortcoming of the manual detection of illegal parking cars,a surveillance algorithm was developed to detect the illegal parking cars based on the image processing technology. A visual sensor was set at the forbidden parking region of the road to record the video sequence. An adaptive mixed Gaussian model was used to extract the background in the complicated environment. The still objects were detected by the temporal sequence feature of the pixel level. The still vehicles were recognized by the regional feature of the object level to get the illegal car parking information. The auto-alarm was realized according to the requirements from the regulation of different forbidden parking regions. The suggested algorithm was validated by the video sequence of the real traffic scenes to be effective.",
7,Smart Detection of Vehicle in Illegal Parking Area by Fusing of Multi-features,"Due to aisle, emergency lanes and other functional areas with rare events and lack of monitoring, an algorithm for smart detection of vehicle in illegal parking area was proposed. Firstly, region of interesting was selected. Secondly, Gaussian Mixture Model was used for background construction, and moving objects were detected by background subtraction. Thirdly, morphological processing was used for detection of relatively complete target, then fusing of ellipse fitting, compacted features detection and tire circularity detection for vehicle recognition. Experiments show that this algorithm could realize monitoring exactly and keep illegal parking area smooth.",2015
8,Multi-Vehicle Tracking Based Traffic Illegal Parking Detection,"Vehicle detection and tracking are the foundations of traffic violation punishment. The current methods have more parameters to be adjusted and can not adapt to the complex traffic scenes. For the purpose of practice application, we propose an illegal parking detection algorithm based on vehicle tracking theory. In order to filter the dynamic interferences such as vehicles parking for a long time, moving vehicles overlapping, and the vehicle losing momentarily from the video, a Gaussian mixture model is combined with the correlations among adjacent pixels to update background and eliminate noises. In allusion to complex traffic scenes, a fast multi-object tracking algorithm is presented to track occluded vehicles effectively. This method predicts vehicle trajectory by Kalman filter and achieves real-time object tracking state judgment by using the feature matching matrix. The experimental results show that this method can track multiple moving vehicles effectively and has high detection precision for illegal parking incidents.",05-Jul
9,Illegal parking detection using object interaction model,"With the development of safe city and surveillance cameras,automatic detection of illegal parking events is of great significance in the video automatic detection methods. Lots of target detection algorithms exist including feature + classifier method,video background subtraction method,and the deep-learning method. These methods are mostly concerned about the position and confirmation of license plates and traffic signs. According to this,a method based on object interaction model to detect illegally parking event is proposed in this paper: Firstly license plate is detected based on contour extraction and SVM; secondly the traffic sign is detected based on the shape and color; the last part judges whether illegal parking exists based on object interaction model.The above-mentioned method is regarded as a validity and reliability method by being tested in the real video scene.",

11,A vehicle detection and tracking algorithm for supervision of illegal parking,"This paper presents a robust vehicle detection and tracking algorithm for supervision of illegal parking. The proposed algorithm is composed of four parts. First, a vehicle detection algorithm is proposed using the improved codebook object detection algorithm to segment moving vehicles from the input sequence. Second, a preprocessing technique using the geometric characteristics of vehicles is employed to exclude non-vehicle objects. Then, the detected vehicles are tracked by an object tracker which incorporates histogram tracking method with Kalman filter. To make the tracking results more accurate, histogram tracking results are used as measurement data for Kalman filter. Finally, Real Stop Counter (RSC) is introduced for trustworthy and accurate performance of the stopped vehicle detection. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can track multiple vehicles simultaneously and detect stopped vehicles successfully in the complicated street environment.",2009
12,Illegal parking road recognition based on video detection equipment,"Based on the big data collected by the video detection equipment, the network topology table of the city level video detection equipment is constructed by using the time relation and the spatial position relation of the data. By using the steepest descent method and adaptive method, the travel confidence time randomness model is constructed, which can describe whether a traveler can finish his travel time on time. It overcomes the shortcomings of the existing travel time reliability calculation model, which is difficult to combine with the actual use of video detection equipment data, then examples analysis are followed. The results show that, for the data collected by the video detection device, the travel confidence time randomness model is more accurate than the existing models. It can describe the probability of the traveler arriving at the destination in a given time more accurately, which can be used to identify illegal parking road and provide a reliable basis for traffic management departments in traffic planning, dividing road network status and traffic situation prediction.",2018
13,Novel Discriminative Method for Illegal Parking and Abandoned Objects,"Computer vision techniques have been widely applied in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) to automatically detect abnormal events and trigger alarms. In the last few years, many abnormal traffic events, such as illegal parking, abandoned objects, speeding, and overloading, have occurred on the highway, threatening traffic safety. In order to distinguish illegal parking and abandoned object events, we propose an effective method to classify these types of abnormal objects. First, abnormal areas are detected by feature point extraction and matching. The transformation relation, between the world and image coordinate systems, is then established by camera calibration. Next, different-height inverse projection planes (IPPs) are built to obtain the inverse projection maps (IPMs). Finally, the 3D information describing the abnormal objects is estimated and used to distinguish illegally parked vehicles and abandoned objects. Experimental results from traffic image sequences show that this method is effective in distinguishing illegal parking and abandoned objects, while its low computational cost satisfies the real-time requirements; furthermore, it can be used in vehicle classification.",2018
14,AN INTEGRATED TRAFFIC MICROSIMULATION MODEL OF ILLEGAL ON-STREET PARKING IN DOWNTOWN TORONTO,"On-street parking involves the blockage of the lane on which a vehicle parks, thus reducing its capacity. As 3 a result, large cities such as the city of Toronto restrict on-street parking on main routes during traffic peak 4 periods. As with any parking restriction, the compliance rate to this policy is not a 100%. This study aims to 5 use Traffic Microsimulation to quantify the impact of illegal on-street parking during the AM peak period 6 on the level of congestion in the city of Toronto. The study uses traffic demands and parking citation data 7 from the year 2011 to simulate existing traffic conditions and reflect the existing level of incompliance to 8 the on-street parking policy. Quadstone Paramics is used to incorporate the illegal parking activity into the 9 Toronto Waterfront Network simulation model. Link delay, travel time, speed and link flow along links 10 affected by illegal parking are the measures of effectiveness that reflect the implications of illegal parking in 11 the study. The base case where no illegal parking is simulated is compared with simulations incorporating 12 illegal parking to derive the difference in travel times resulting from illegal parking. It is observed thst on 13 average link delay increases by 50% and link flow reduces by 7% upon introducing illegal on-street parking 14 onto a link",2017
15,Deep Learning-Based Parking Detection System Using Structural Similarity,"High latency of existing vision-based parking detection systems causes significant delay in parking information delivery. The lack of access to real-time outdoor parking information induces the difficulty of finding parking and identifying parking violations, especially in busy downtown areas. Given such backdrop, this research project put forward a deep learning-based parking detection system that accurately detects parking occupancy status and illegal parking on real time basis. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier running on a single board computer is used to classify the occupancy status of parking spaces and identify the presence of illegally parked vehicles. A novel structural similarity (SSIM) decision scheme is introduced to minimize the latency of detecting parking occupancy changes. Multithreading technique is also employed to fully exploit the processing power of single board computer for accelerating illegal parking detection process. The detection results are stored at a cloud-hosted NoSQL database. Two smartphone applications namely Driver App and Enforcer App are developed to channel live parking information for assisting drivers in finding parking and supporting efficient parking enforcement respectively. The proposed parking detection mechanism is implemented and tested at the staff parking area (monitored with an IP camera) of Faculty of Engineering in Multimedia University. Experimental results demonstrated a high accuracy of over 99% in parking occupancy detection and 98.7% precision rate in locating illegal parking incidents with no missed detection under different weather conditions. The implementation of SSIM decision scheme in detecting a single instance of parking occupancy change, managed to accelerate the parking occupancy detection by up to six times faster when compared to a pure CNN classification approach. On the other hand, the incorporation of multithreading mechanism on single board computer increases the computation speed of illegal parking detection in three illegal parking regions by 2.3 times in comparison with sequential execution.",2019
16,A Robust Parking Detection Algorithm Against Electric Railway Magnetic Field Interference,"Wireless magnetic sensor networks (WMSNs) offer an effective and efficient low-cost alternative for real-time parking space monitoring. Current algorithms used for parking space detection based on the WMSNs have been well studied but not without eliminating the geomagnetic field interference. Electric railway systems, such as subways and light rail systems, produce magnetic field radiation that interferes with the geomagnetic field. The electric railway magnetic field interference has increased and is prominent in urban settings; therefore, it is imperative to filter out the interference in order to increase the detection accuracy. This paper proposes an algorithm for parking space detection, which can effectively eliminate the geomagnetic background interference. We solve the parking detection problem through signal filtering technology. Based on mathematical morphology, we designed two filters for extracting morphological structures from interfered magnetic signals. The experimental results verify that the proposed algorithm is more accurate than the existing algorithms.",2020
17,Detection of street-parking vehicles from panoramic street image,"It is important to assess street-parking vehicles causing traffic problems in urban areas, however, it is performed manually and at high cost. It is a top priority for reducing cost, to develop a detection system of those vehicles. We address a spatio-temporal volume and two types of slice surfaces from the volume, and introduce two-types of panoramic street-images, which possibly provide useful information for our daily life. We propose two alternative detection methods, using a laser-range finder and a line-scan camera. In the former detection method, EPI analysis is applied to line-scan images. As a result of verification experiments in real roads, a detection rate reached 76.9%. In the latter detection method, two kinds of cluster analysis are applied to range points: one is for clustering points at each scan, and the other for clustering points over several scans. Each cluster of range points means a vehicle. As a result of verification experiments in real roads, a detection rate reached 90%.",2013
18,Crowdsensing Maps of On-street Parking Spaces,"It has been estimated that traffic congestion costs the world economy hundreds of billions of dollars each year, increases pollution, and has a negative impact on the overall quality of life in metropolitan areas. A significant part of congestion in urban areas is due to vehicles searching for on-street parking. Detailed and accurate on-street parking maps can help drivers easily locate areas with large numbers of legal parking spaces and thus relieve congestion. In this paper, we address the problem of mapping street parking spaces using vehicles' preinstalled parking sensors. In particular, we focus on identifying legal parking spaces from crowdsourced data, whereas earlier work has largely assumed that such maps of legal spaces are given. We demonstrate that crowdsensing data from vehicle parking sensors can be used to classify on-street areas into legal/illegal parking spaces. Based on more than 2 million data points collected in Highland Park, NJ and downtown Brooklyn, NY areas, we show that on-street parking maps can be estimated with an accuracy of ~90% using proposed weighted occupancy rate thresholding algorithm.",2013
19,Attribute Grammar-Based Event Recognition and Anomaly Detection,We propose to use attribute grammars for recognizing normal events and detecting abnormal events in a video. Attribute grammars can describe constraints on features (attributes) in addition to the syntactic structure of the input. Events are recognized using an extension of the Earley parser that handles attributes and concurrent event threads. Abnormal events are detected when the input does not follow syntax of the grammar or the attributes do not satisfy the constraints in the attribute grammar to some degree. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for the task of recognizing normal events and detecting anomalies in a parking lot.,2006
20,Automatic traffic violation detection system and method of the same,"Disclosed herein are a system and method for the automatic detection of traffic and parking violations. Camera input is digitally analyzed for vehicle type and location. This information is then processed against local traffic and parking regulations to detect violations. Detectable driving offenses include, but are not limited to: no scooters, buses only, and scooters only lane violations. Detectable parking offenses include, but are not limited to: parking or loitering in bus stops, parking next to fire hydrants, and parking in no-parking zones. Camera input, detected vehicle information, and violations can be stored for later search and retrieval. The system may be configured to signal the authorities or other automated analysis systems about specific violations. When coupled with automatic license plate recognition, vehicles may be automatically matched against a registration database and reported or ticketed.",2012
21,Proceedings of the International Academic Conference on Frontiers in Social Sciences and Management Innovation,"Violation of parking is a legal term. Our country¡¯s law stipulates that there should be no-stop signs and markings, road sections with isolation facilities between motor vehicles and non-motor vehicle lanes and sidewalks, and crosswalks and construction sites. No parking; Railway crossings, sharp bends, narrow roads with widths less than 4 meters, bridges, steep slopes, tunnels, and sections within 50 meters of the above locations are not allowed to stop. In recent years, urban management is gradually developing towards information There are corresponding treatment mechanisms for illegal parking in urban management, but the method of detecting illegal parking based on machine vision is still under study. This paper takes a street in Hebei Province as the research object, and studies the illegal parking under the surveillance image. It also proposes to use the machine vision-based method to automatically detect the illegal parking. In the monitoring image, according to the street view image information detected by the computer, A status assessment of the vehicle placement can be achieved. The detection algorithm in this paper uses the multi-angle suggestion area to accurately locate the offending vehicles in the image and mark them on the detected vehicles. The experimental data shows that the algorithm has good adaptability to the detection of illegal parking in surveillance images, and effectively improves the inspection efficiency.",2019
22,"Illegal-parking-management portable terminal, illegal-parking management method and computer program product","An illegal-parking-management portable terminal includes a storage unit, an extracting unit, and a selecting unit. The storage unit stores therein facility information on a facility relevant to illegal parking and an illegal-parking application rule that defines illegal-parking condition for each penalty article. The extracting unit extracts, from the facility information, information on a facility within a predetermined range from a position specified as a vehicle parking position on a map displayed on a display unit. The selecting unit compares the extracted information with the illegal-parking application rule, and selects a penalty article to be applied to illegal parking of a vehicle.",2005
23,Automatic detection of long term parked cars,"The detection of illegal roadside parking is becoming more and more interesting in the field of intelligent transportation systems, since it may cause traffic congestion or accidents. In this paper we propose a method able to analyze videos acquired by traditional surveillance cameras and to automatically detect the vehicles stopped in a forbidden area. Two main contributions have been introduced: first, spatio temporal information related to the stopped vehicles are encoded by a heat map; second, the background is not updated by evaluating the movement of the vehicle in a single time instant, but instead the whole movement of the vehicles, encoded into the heat map, is taken into account. Two widely adopted datasets, namely the iLids and the PETS 2000, have been used to experimentally evaluate the proposed approach and the results achieved, compared with state of the art methodologies, confirm its effectiveness.",2015
24,Vehicle Tracking by Simultaneous Detection and Viewpoint Estimation,"We address the problem of vehicle detection and tracking for traffic monitoring in Smart City applications. We introduce a novel approach for vehicle tracking by simultaneous detection and viewpoint estimation. An Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is adapted to describe the vehicle¡¯s motion when not only the pose of the object is measured, but also its viewpoint with respect to the camera. Specifically, we enhance the motion model with observations of the vehicle viewpoint jointly extracted by the detection step. The approach is evaluated on a novel and challenging dataset with different video sequences recorded at urban environments, which is released with the paper. Our experimental validation confirms that the integration of an EKF with both detections and viewpoint estimations results beneficial.",2013
25,Parking violation surveillance system,A parking control surveillance system is provided for monitoring vehicles within parking spaces for providing parking enforcement personnel information concerning authorized and unauthorized vehicles within the parking space. The parking control surveillance system includes a parking stop having dimensions substantially the same as traditional cement parking stops located at the rear of a parking space. The parking stop includes a video recorder for obtaining images of vehicles entering or exiting the designated parking space. The parking stop further includes a transmitter for transmitting images and information such as the time of parking transgression to vehicle enforcement personnel.,2006
26,Detection Method of Highway Illegal Parking Based on Gaussian Mixture Model,"In order to solve the problem of illegal parking on highway,a detection method based on video image processing technology was proposed. Gaussian mixture model was used to collect the video sequence to realize background modeling. The background difference method was used to obtain the target foreground object and the background update method was also used to reduce the influence of environmental factors on the background model. Through the proposed target centroid method,not only the moving vehicle detection in designated area can be realized but also the illegal parking targets can be identified and alerted. Finally,the results of the experiment which have been done on a certain highway to verify the video sequence of the highway traffic scenes show that the proposed algorithm has the merits of strong scene adaptability,good efficiency and high veracity.",2014
27,Real-Time Non-Motor Vehicle Violation Detection in Traffic Scenes,"The blockchain technology in the traffic scene is developing rapidly recently. In this area, distributed system based technology like blockchain has been standing out with its decentralization, data-innovation and data transparency. We propose a real-time non-motor vehicle violation detecting approach, which can detect and collect violation information of non-motor vehicle and has been integrated into the distributed smart traffic management system. We propose a luminance balancing in the pre-processing steps to address the problem of brightness change in the background. We use the refined codebook algorithm to detect the motion part, and then propose a violation judging criteria based on feature matching to obtain the violation information. Experiments and application have shown the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.",2019
28,Vehicle Detection Even in Poor Visibility Conditions Using Infrared Thermal Images and Its Application to Road Traffic Flow Monitoring,"We propose an algorithm for detecting vehicle positions and their movements by using thermal images obtained through an infrared thermography camera. The proposed algorithm specifies the area of moving vehicles based on the variations of pixel values, i.e. the standard deviations of pixel values along the time direction of spatio-temporal images. It also specifies vehicle positions by applying the pattern recognition algorithm which uses Haar-like features per frame of the images. Moreover, to increase the accuracy of vehicle detection, correction procedures for misrecognition of vehicles are employed. The results of our experiments show that the information about both vehicle positions and their movements can be obtained by combining those two kinds of detection, and the vehicle detection accuracy is 96.3?%. As an application of the algorithm, we also propose a method for estimating traffic flow conditions based on the results obtained by the algorithm. By use of the method for estimating traffic flow conditions, automatic traffic flow monitoring can be achieved. In addition, there is a possibility that traffic accidents, vehicle troubles, and illegal parking can be detected with the proposed method. By using the traffic information obtained from the proposed method, we also expect to realize an optimized traffic signal control around the clock even in changeable weather.",2012
29,Algorithm of Generating Adaptive Background Modeling for crackdown on Illegal Parking,"The Object tracking by real-time image analysis is one of the major concerns in computer vision and its application fields. The Object detection process of real-time images must be preceded before the object tracking process. To achieve the stable object detection performance in the exterior environment, adaptive background model generation methods are needed. The adaptive background model can accept the nature's phenomena changes and adapt the system to the changes such as light or shadow movements that are caused by changes of meridian altitudes of the sun. In this paper, we propose a robust background model generation method effective in an illegal parking auto-detection application area. We also provide a evaluation method that judges whether a moving vehicle stops or not. As the first step, an initial background model is generated. Then the differences between the initial model and the input image frame is used to trace the movement of object. The moving vehicle can be easily recognized from the object tracking process. After that, the model is updated by the background information except the moving object. These steps are repeated. The experiment results show that our background model is effective and adaptable in the variable exterior environment. The results also show our model can detect objects moving slowly. This paper includes the performance evaluation results of the proposed method on the real roads.",2008
30,Illegally Parked Vehicles Detection Based on Omnidirectional Computer Vision,"At present, vision-based illegally parked vehicles detection faces a range of issues such as narrowness of detection range, low detection precision and robustness. This paper proposed a technique for illegally parked vehicles detection. Firstly, Omni-Directional Vision Sensors (ODVS) are used to access Omni-directional images of the scene. Secondly, a method based on two backgrounds modeled by Gaussian mixture model (GMM) with different learning rate is presented. Through simple arithmetic, it is capable to segment temporarily static vehicles in the scene. This method is computational efficient and robust because of the avoidance of a series of complex operations of merging, splitting, entering, leaving, occlusion, and correspondence which are met in traditional methodology depending on object-tracking. Thirdly, shadow suppression is used to overcome the impact of vehicles' own shadow on the detection precision. Experimental results show that the technique can effectively detect illegally parked vehicles with high precision and robustness.",2009
31,Recognizing the Illegal Parking Patterns of Cars on the Road in Front of the Bus Stop Using the Support Vector Machine,"Traffic jams are a major problem in the lives of people in the capital. The occurrence of such problems is due to drivers who do not respect traffic laws, inappropriate behavior of the driver, and the cause of illegal parking at prohibited parking, resulting in the rear car unable to move further. Possible or the car must change lanes to another lane. Therefore, to reduce such problems, we have developed an illegal parking pattern recognition system for cars on the road. We have applied the Support Vector Machine (SVM) to the signal from CCTV cameras and find important characteristics of illegal car parked at the bus stop. Then use those images to learn to recognize the parking behavior of cars with Linear Regression. From the experiment, it is found that the recognition of cars parked on the road in front of the bus stop has an accuracy rate of 82.22 percent which can be used to detect the soaking of personal cars in real life.",2019
32,Image processing based system for classification of vehicles for parking purposes,"This paper develops an image processing based approach for classification of vehicles with the objective of their parking. In the paper, the heights and lengths of the vehicles are first measured on applying image processing and feature extraction techniques. Then, based on the information of the heights and lengths of the vehicles, the vehicles' eligibility to park in a specific parking lot is determined under condition of certain constraints. The determination of the heights and lengths are carried out by comparing the maximum height for a set of vehicles. The system was implemented using MATLAB and the developed technique was tested for accuracy considering various classes of vehicles. For ease of implementation, the system incorporates a camera mounted on a flat surface with fixed pixel setting.",2015
33,Peccancy Parking Intelligent Monitoring System Based on Computer Vision,"Aiming at the problems of peccancy parking detection in a large range,uncertainty of time and location,vehicles with multiple size and species as well as automatic recognition of vehicle license plate,this paper designed a peccancy parking intelligent monitoring system based on the fusion of Omni-Directional Vision Sensors(ODVS) and PTZ camera.The ODVS is used to detect and track multiple targets of vehicle object in a large range to acquire the vehicle information such as location,size and trajectory.Once a tracked vehicle is stopped but not in the parking spaces for a period of time,the PTZ camera will be controlled to capture the vehicle image which will be used to recognize the vehicle license plate.The experimental results show that image used for vehicle license plate recognition can be captured under unlimited conditions by this device,and the demands of the Real-time Multi-objective detection and tracking can also be met.The system will not only provide warning information to drivers who might be peccancy parking,but also gives digital urban management and law enforcement departments a pair of intelligent eye.",2006
34,Intelligent drone-based surveillance: application to parking lot monitoring and detection,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones are rapidly gaining popularity in the field of remote sensing for capturing images with ultra-high spatial resolution while flying at lower altitudes. Development of highlyefficient miniaturized sensors and the use of geospatial image processing techniques have been immensely helpful in growing this technology as the most sought-after and sophisticated remote sensing technique at a relatively lower cost. Parking lot occupancy detection, one of the current drone based application area, can be used for effective management of parking spaces, to reduce queues, minimize the time required to find an area, and to issue tickets in cases of parking violations. Visual information based parking lot monitoring techniques are mostly tailored for specific applications, and they lack generalization. In this paper, a UAV-assisted quick and efficient monitoring solution is proposed for real-time parking occupancy and car number plate detection. In this approach, a drone-mounted camera has been used to capture images of the parking lot under consideration. Initially, the parking lot is being mapped using drone-coordinates, and then a dynamic programming algorithm is used to determine the shortest route to cover multiple parking lots in minimum time to capture maximum number pictures solved by the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). For capturing images, an optimum location is used, such that the drone can cover the maximum area of a parking space in minimum time. Depending on the parking area under investigation, paths altitudes and gimbal angles of the drone is changed dynamically while capturing images. Then a deep neural network based parking lot occupancy monitoring system is used to determine the number of occupied and vacant spots in a parking lot. The drone captured images of each parking spot are then tested with a pre-trained model based on car and non-car images. Then the automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) algorithm is used for parking rule enforcement. Finally, experimental results are verified using a web based application that is connected with a cloud database.",2019
35,iParking ? a real-time parking space monitoring and guiding system,"Shortage and imbalance of parking spaces have become serious problems in recent years. Drivers may choose nearby illegal area for parking when available parking spaces are all out of sight. To mitigate problems such as illegal parking, iParking, a real-time parking space monitoring and guiding system, is proposed in this paper. The paper lays emphasis on?roadside?parking. In the proposed system, the availability of parking spaces is recognized through image analysis, where the images come from the event recorders embedded in cars on the roads. Upon receipt of a parking request, the system searches for a nearest parking space, and then directly navigates the requesting driver to the available parking space. The system is expected to benefit all drivers and the government, and to improve safety and traffic on the roads",2017
36,Social Media Application for Illegal Parking Problem,"Illegal parking is one of the major causes of traffic congestion. Among many ways to mitigate illegal parking, a high level of direct traffic enforcement has been shown to have the strongest impact. Traffic enforcement must invest substantial human resources in patrolling and issuing parking tickets for illegally parked cards. The work load is overwhelming and efficiency is low since the illegal parking occurs almost everywhere in urban areas. This study tries to help traffic related officers ease their work load but minimize illegal parking by implementing social media networking. Social media in China has a significant number of users which covers nearly every urban area so that the service users can be public police officers to make traffic flow better in the city. The aim of this research is to develop the smartphone-based application and see its possible potential. The first part of this paper will describe the WeChat based application, which collects information on illegal parking cars from the public. It includes user interfaces, an automatic warning system, a parking navigation system, and data visualization. The second part demonstrates the process of the practical operation in Suzhou, China. Finally, the authors conclude the advantages and further development of this application. In addition, features of the illegal parking problem and parking planning problem in Suzhou are discussed.",2017

39,Design of Notification System Illegal Parking Vehicles on Campus,"The increase in the number of private cars as well as non-standard parked behavior has brought great pressure to campus traffic. In order to control this non-standard parked behavior, orderly and reasonable guide and regulate owners to develop good parking habits, we design a vehicle parking violation notification system. A system is designed in the article to record illegal parking information of vehicles. A working principle of this system is that a wireless MMS image terminal captures image information of illegal vehicles, and real-time transmits the captured image information to the Data Center Computer in Security Department of the school through the GPRS network, so as to achieve illegal vehicle information is timely recorded and notified. Meanwhile, outside campus of illegal vehicles will be warned or limited its re-enter the campus. After a year of work and testing, the entire system is stable, and the image information transmission failure rate is very low. Illegal parking behavior on campus has been significantly curbed, and traffic order has been significantly improved.",2014

41,Available car parking space detection from webcam by using adaptive mixing features,"This paper presents a robust approach for detection of available car parking spaces. With low quality of video camera as webcam and dynamic change of light around the car parking, it is hard to accurately detect or recognize the cars. Moreover the proposed appearance-based approach is efficient than recognition-based approach because it do not need to learn a huge of multi-view objects. In this paper, we propose adaptive background model-based object detection with dynamic mixing features of masked-area and edge orientation histogram (EOH) density. The average variance of variance of intensity change for dynamic background model is used to change ratio of mixing features dynamically. The masked-area density is density of predefined area of a parking slot that is weighted by Gaussian mask to robust density computation and the edge orientation histogram (EOH) density is density of the EOH in the predefined area that can be used under low contrast image as night scene. The experiments are performed both in simulation model and real scenes. The results show the proposed approach can handle dynamic change of light efficiently.",2012

44,Proceedings of the International Academic Conference on Frontiers in Social Sciences and Management Innovation,"In recent years, urban management is gradually developing towards informationization. There are corresponding processing mechanisms for illegal billboards and illegal parking in urban management, but the method of detecting illegal billboards based on machine vision is still under study. At present, the automatic detection method of illegal billboards based on machine vision is generally carried out under ideal conditions, and the experiment is carried out under a simple background. This paper takes a street in Hebei Province as the research object, and studies the illegal billboard area under natural conditions, and proposes to use the machine vision-based method to automatically detect the illegal billboards. In the surveillance image, according to the street scene detected by the computer. Image information enables status evaluation of billboard placement. The detection algorithm of this paper uses the multi-angle suggestion area to accurately locate the illegal billboards in the image, and mark the detected billboards. Compared with the direct detection of the billboard in the image, the interference of the background factor on the target area is removed, and the false detection rate is effectively reduced. In billboard detection, this paper proposes an improved region suggestion algorithm to generate higher quality candidate regions in an image for adapting to billboards of various poses under natural conditions. Experimental data shows that the algorithm has good adaptability to the detection of billboards in surveillance images.",2019
45,An Effective Algorithm for Video-Based Parking and Drop Event Detection,"Real-time and accurate detection of parking and dropping events on the road is important for the avoidance of traffic accidents. The existing algorithms for detection require accurate modeling of the background, and most of them use the characteristics of two-dimensional images such as area to distinguish the type of the target. However, these algorithms significantly depend on the background and are lack of accuracy on the type of distinction. Therefore, this paper proposes an algorithm for detecting parking and dropping objects that uses real three-dimensional information to distinguish the type of target. Firstly, an abnormal region is initially defined based on status change, when there is an object that did not exist before in the traffic scene. Secondly, the preliminary determination of the abnormal area is bidirectionally tracked to determine the area of parking and dropping objects, and the eight-neighbor seed filling algorithm is used to segment the parking and the dropping object area. Finally, a three-view recognition method based on inverse projection is proposed to distinguish the parking and dropping objects. The method is based on the matching of the three-dimensional structure of the vehicle body. In addition, the three-dimensional wireframe of the vehicle extracted by the back-projection can be used to match the structural model of the vehicle, and the vehicle model can be further identified. The 3D wireframe of the established vehicle is efficient and can meet the needs of real-time applications. And, based on experimental data collected in tunnels, highways, urban expressways, and rural roads, the proposed algorithm is verified. The results show that the algorithm can effectively detect the parking and dropping objects within different environment, with low miss and false detection rate.",2019
46,Applications of artificial intelligence in real-time video analytics,"Illegal parking can be a ubiquitous concern faced by urban cities, posing potential traffic impediments and safety risks to other road users. Despite having surveillance systems deployed to monitor traffic offences, the videos recorded are often stored only for post-event forensics. Manually inspecting the videos often involves repetitive human labour, which is tedious and prone to errors. In this project, a fully automated pipeline to perform end-to-end illegal parking detection with minimal or no human-in-the-loop was proposed. The pipeline first consists of vehicle detection using a deep learning based object detection algorithm, You Only Look Once Version 3 (YOLOv3), to detect vehicles. Next, movement tracking using template matching and Intersection over Union (IoU) are performed to track the time since the violating vehicle has remained stationary. The last step is to extract the license plate, using OpenALPR, of the violating vehicle which has remained stationary for a defined period. With the fully automated pipeline in place, the dataset can be intelligently leveraged and the analysis can be automated in real-time. Empirical results show high accuracy of vehicle detection and movement tracking module with the license plate detection module achieving a decent performance. However, improvements can be made by retraining its underlying license plate detection and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine with the dataset from the location which the system is to be implemented on.",2019
47,Traffic violation detection and deterrence: Implications for automatic policing,"Current efforts directed at enforcing traffic laws are beset by a dilemma. On the one hand enforcement programmes are limited in duration and intensity, thereby producing weak halo effects on drivers' behaviour. On the other hand, public attitudes towards compliance are largely conditioned by the visibility of enforcement programmes. This paper reviews the impact of the semi-automatic monitoring systems in improving detection in traffic law programmes. The effects of the technology on drivers' behaviour are assessed and implications for the development of a fully automatic traffic policing system are teased out. Secondly, the paper attempts to put into perspective any consequences that an automatic monitoring system may have for driver behaviour. The fact that such systems do not yet exist poses problems for an ergonomics evaluation of their projected impact. However, taking into account the existence of core technology, tentative conclusions can be drawn as to the likely benefits and disadvantages of such systems.",1991

The purpose of this integrated system is to provide a method to identify different types of traffic violations and to reduce the number of systems used to record violations. This method receives input from traffic surveillance camera and uses DNN to classify the vehicles to reduce the number of personnel needed to do this manually.

49,Illegally Parked Vehicle Detection using Deep Learning and Key-point Tracking,"In this paper, we present a method for identifying and tracking illegally parked vehicles. This approach is based on deep learning for vehicles detection and hand crafted descriptors for the tracking which are designed to cope with occlusions. The tracking of the parked vehicle is achieved by key-point extraction of the detected vehicles and feature point matching. For each frame, a bounding box was generated to represent the vehicle and feature points extracted in that area. All parked vehicles have a unique ID which was generated by the Hungarian algorithm and Kalman filter, and the parked vehicle with the same ID was matched frame by frame. Based on this matching result, the stationary vehicles in the forbidden area can be tracked. Our approach tested efficiency and robustness on a public database and is shown to produce state of the art results.",2019
50,Parked Car Detection Method Based on Home Wireless LAN -Using Household Equipment to Detect a Parked Car-,"Consumer-to-consumer (C2C) car park sharing services are now widespread. In these services, space owners rent their unused land, e.g., an unused parking space next to the owner¡¯s home, to a driver. Different from coin parking services, drivers using the park sharing services can make reservations through web sites or mobile-phone applications. There are drivers who abuse this system by, for example, overstaying their reservation. The high cost of parking space sensors that monitor the existence of a parked car makes it cost prohibitive for individuals to install these types of equipment to deter the abuse of parking spaces. To address this problem, we propose a parked car detection technique employing wireless LAN. The proposed method utilizes a household wireless LAN access point and a household laptop computer, and we monitor the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) of beacon frames. This unique method reduces the detection cost and will aid in proliferating car park sharing services. In this paper, we detect the existence of a car in a parking space using the mean and variance of the RSSI. The generated datasets are used for Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and the K-nearest neighbor algorithm (KNN) binary classification. We previously showed that a parked car can be detected when the locations of the equipment are the same. In this study, we show the effect of changing the equipment location in the house on the detection score. These results show that the best recall score is 0.88 and that changing the equipment location does not affect the recall score. The results of this study are expected to be used in a multimodal system.",2020

Accordingly, automated systems have been designed for numerous detection tasks, but the task of detecting illegally parked vehicles has been left largely to the human operators of surveillance systems. We propose a methodology for detecting this event in real time by applying a novel image projection that reduces the dimensionality of the data and, thus, reduces the computational complexity of the segmentation and tracking processes. After event detection, we invert the transformation to recover the original appearance of the vehicle and to allow for further processing that may require 2-D data. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm using the i-LIDS vehicle detection challenge datasets as well as videos we have taken ourselves. These videos test the algorithm in a variety of outdoor conditions, including nighttime video and instances of sudden changes in weather.",05-Jun
52,Real-Time Illegal Parking Detection System Based on Deep Learning,"The increasing illegal parking has become more and more serious. Nowadays the methods of detecting illegally parked vehicles are based on background segmentation. However, this method is weakly robust and sensitive to environment. Benefitting from deep learning, this paper proposes a novel illegal vehicle parking detection system. Illegal vehicles captured by camera are firstly located and classified by the famous Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) algorithm. To improve the performance, we propose to optimize SSD by adjusting the aspect ratio of default box to accommodate with our dataset better. After that, a tracking and analysis of movement is adopted to judge the illegal vehicles in the region of interest (ROI). Experiments show that the system can achieve a 99% accuracy and real-time (25FPS) detection with strong robustness in complex environments.",05-Jul

55,A Deep Learning based Illegal Parking Detection Platform,"Illegal parking is a critical problem in large, growing cities. Currently, the responsibility for detecting illegally parked vehicles has been left to law enforcement, which often requires manual inspection. To improve the efficiency of law enforcement for vehicle parking management, we propose a web-based analytic platform that leverages recent advancements in computer vision. This proposed platform provides an algorithm to improve the performance of detecting vehicle license plates from videos, based on an existing deep learning approach. Also, we provide a method to estimate vehicle parking locations. This platform is applicable for videos of security patrolling. End-users can define restricted zones via a map-based interface and all vehicles located in these areas can be efficiently identified once patrolling videos are received. This system is evaluated by two videos captured in real-world parking lots. The results indicate that the proposed platform can successfully identify vehicle plate numbers and estimate their parking locations to support the management of urban parking infrastructure.",05-Jul

A visual sensor was set at the forbidden parking region of the road to record the video sequence. An adaptive mixed Gaussian model was used to extract the background in the complicated environment. The still objects were detected by the temporal sequence feature of the pixel level.

58,Multi-Vehicle Tracking Based Traffic Illegal Parking Detection,"Vehicle detection and tracking are the foundations of traffic violation punishment. The current methods have more parameters to be adjusted and can not adapt to the complex traffic scenes. For the purpose of practice application, we propose an illegal parking detection algorithm based on vehicle tracking theory. In order to filter the dynamic interferences such as vehicles parking for a long time, moving vehicles overlapping, and the vehicle losing momentarily from the video, a Gaussian mixture model is combined with the correlations among adjacent pixels to update background and eliminate noises. In allusion to complex traffic scenes, a fast multi-object tracking algorithm is presented to track occluded vehicles effectively.

Lots of target detection algorithms exist including feature + classifier method,video background subtraction method,and the deep-learning method. These methods are mostly concerned about the position and confirmation of license plates and traffic signs. According to this,a method based on object interaction model to detect illegally parking event is proposed in this paper: Firstly license plate is detected based on contour extraction and SVM; secondly the traffic sign is detected based on the shape and color; the last part judges whether illegal parking exists based on object interaction model.The above-mentioned method is regarded as a validity and reliability method by being tested in the real video scene.",

The proposed algorithm is composed of four parts. First, a vehicle detection algorithm is proposed using the improved codebook object detection algorithm to segment moving vehicles from the input sequence. Second, a preprocessing technique using the geometric characteristics of vehicles is employed to exclude non-vehicle objects. Then, the detected vehicles are tracked by an object tracker which incorporates histogram tracking method with Kalman filter. To make the tracking results more accurate, histogram tracking results are used as measurement data for Kalman filter.

62,Illegal parking road recognition based on video detection equipment,"Based on the big data collected by the video detection equipment, the network topology table of the city level video detection equipment is constructed by using the time relation and the spatial position relation of the data. By using the steepest descent method and adaptive method, the travel confidence time randomness model is constructed, which can describe whether a traveler can finish his travel time on time. It overcomes the shortcomings of the existing travel time reliability calculation model, which is difficult to combine with the actual use of video detection equipment data, then examples analysis are followed. The results show that, for the data collected by the video detection device, the travel confidence time randomness model is more accurate than the existing models.

63,Novel Discriminative Method for Illegal Parking and Abandoned Objects,"Computer vision techniques have been widely applied in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) to automatically detect abnormal events and trigger alarms. In the last few years, many abnormal traffic events, such as illegal parking, abandoned objects, speeding, and overloading, have occurred on the highway, threatening traffic safety. In order to distinguish illegal parking and abandoned object events, we propose an effective method to classify these types of abnormal objects. First, abnormal areas are detected by feature point extraction and matching. The transformation relation, between the world and image coordinate systems, is then established by camera calibration. Next, different-height inverse projection planes (IPPs) are built to obtain the inverse projection maps (IPMs). Finally, the 3D information describing the abnormal objects is estimated and used to distinguish illegally parked vehicles and abandoned objects. Experimental results from traffic image sequences show that this method is effective in distinguishing illegal parking and abandoned objects, while its low computational cost satisfies the real-time requirements; furthermore, it can be used in vehicle classification.",2018
64,AN INTEGRATED TRAFFIC MICROSIMULATION MODEL OF ILLEGAL ON-STREET PARKING IN DOWNTOWN TORONTO,"On-street parking involves the blockage of the lane on which a vehicle parks, thus reducing its capacity. As 3 a result, large cities such as the city of Toronto restrict on-street parking on main routes during traffic peak 4 periods. As with any parking restriction, the compliance rate to this policy is not a 100%. This study aims to 5 use Traffic Microsimulation to quantify the impact of illegal on-street parking during the AM peak period 6 on the level of congestion in the city of Toronto. The study uses traffic demands and parking citation data 7 from the year 2011 to simulate existing traffic conditions and reflect the existing level of incompliance to 8 the on-street parking policy. Quadstone Paramics is used to incorporate the illegal parking activity into the 9 Toronto Waterfront Network simulation model. Link delay, travel time, speed and link flow along links 10 affected by illegal parking are the measures of effectiveness that reflect the implications of illegal parking in 11 the study. The base case where no illegal parking is simulated is compared with simulations incorporating 12 illegal parking to derive the difference in travel times resulting from illegal parking. It is observed thst on 13 average link delay increases by 50% and link flow reduces by 7% upon introducing illegal on-street parking 14 onto a link",2017
65,Deep Learning-Based Parking Detection System Using Structural Similarity,"High latency of existing vision-based parking detection systems causes significant delay in parking information delivery. The lack of access to real-time outdoor parking information induces the difficulty of finding parking and identifying parking violations, especially in busy downtown areas. Given such backdrop, this research project put forward a deep learning-based parking detection system that accurately detects parking occupancy status and illegal parking on real time basis. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier running on a single board computer is used to classify the occupancy status of parking spaces and identify the presence of illegally parked vehicles. A novel structural similarity (SSIM) decision scheme is introduced to minimize the latency of detecting parking occupancy changes. Multithreading technique is also employed to fully exploit the processing power of single board computer for accelerating illegal parking detection process. The detection results are stored at a cloud-hosted NoSQL database. Two smartphone applications namely Driver App and Enforcer App are developed to channel live parking information for assisting drivers in finding parking and supporting efficient parking enforcement respectively. The proposed parking detection mechanism is implemented and tested at the staff parking area (monitored with an IP camera) of Faculty of Engineering in Multimedia University. Experimental results demonstrated a high accuracy of over 99% in parking occupancy detection and 98.7% precision rate in locating illegal parking incidents with no missed detection under different weather conditions. The implementation of SSIM decision scheme in detecting a single instance of parking occupancy change, managed to accelerate the parking occupancy detection by up to six times faster when compared to a pure CNN classification approach. On the other hand, the incorporation of multithreading mechanism on single board computer increases the computation speed of illegal parking detection in three illegal parking regions by 2.3 times in comparison with sequential execution.",2019
66,A Robust Parking Detection Algorithm Against Electric Railway Magnetic Field Interference,"Wireless magnetic sensor networks (WMSNs) offer an effective and efficient low-cost alternative for real-time parking space monitoring. Current algorithms used for parking space detection based on the WMSNs have been well studied but not without eliminating the geomagnetic field interference. Electric railway systems, such as subways and light rail systems, produce magnetic field radiation that interferes with the geomagnetic field. The electric railway magnetic field interference has increased and is prominent in urban settings; therefore, it is imperative to filter out the interference in order to increase the detection accuracy. This paper proposes an algorithm for parking space detection, which can effectively eliminate the geomagnetic background interference. We solve the parking detection problem through signal filtering technology. Based on mathematical morphology, we designed two filters for extracting morphological structures from interfered magnetic signals. The experimental results verify that the proposed algorithm is more accurate than the existing algorithms.",2020

It is a top priority for reducing cost, to develop a detection system of those vehicles. We address a spatio-temporal volume and two types of slice surfaces from the volume, and introduce two-types of panoramic street-images, which possibly provide useful information for our daily life. We propose two alternative detection methods, using a laser-range finder and a line-scan camera. In the former detection method, EPI analysis is applied to line-scan images. As a result of verification experiments in real roads, a detection rate reached 76.9%. In the latter detection method, two kinds of cluster analysis are applied to range points: one is for clustering points at each scan, and the other for clustering points over several scans. Each cluster of range points means a vehicle. As a result of verification experiments in real roads, a detection rate reached 90%.",2013
68,Crowdsensing Maps of On-street Parking Spaces,"It has been estimated that traffic congestion costs the world economy hundreds of billions of dollars each year, increases pollution, and has a negative impact on the overall quality of life in metropolitan areas. A significant part of congestion in urban areas is due to vehicles searching for on-street parking. Detailed and accurate on-street parking maps can help drivers easily locate areas with large numbers of legal parking spaces and thus relieve congestion. In this paper, we address the problem of mapping street parking spaces using vehicles' preinstalled parking sensors. In particular, we focus on identifying legal parking spaces from crowdsourced data, whereas earlier work has largely assumed that such maps of legal spaces are given. We demonstrate that crowdsensing data from vehicle parking sensors can be used to classify on-street areas into legal/illegal parking spaces. Based on more than 2 million data points collected in Highland Park, NJ and downtown Brooklyn, NY areas, we show that on-street parking maps can be estimated with an accuracy of ~90% using proposed weighted occupancy rate thresholding algorithm.",2013

Abnormal events are detected when the input does not follow syntax of the grammar or the attributes do not satisfy the constraints in the attribute grammar to some degree. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for the task of recognizing normal events and detecting anomalies in a parking lot.,2006

We introduce a novel approach for vehicle tracking by simultaneous detection and viewpoint estimation. An Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is adapted to describe the vehicle¡¯s motion when not only the pose of the object is measured, but also its viewpoint with respect to the camera. Specifically, we enhance the motion model with observations of the vehicle viewpoint jointly extracted by the detection step.

In this area, distributed system based technology like blockchain has been standing out with its decentralization, data-innovation and data transparency. We propose a real-time non-motor vehicle violation detecting approach, which can detect and collect violation information of non-motor vehicle and has been integrated into the distributed smart traffic management system.

78,Vehicle Detection Even in Poor Visibility Conditions Using Infrared Thermal Images and Its Application to Road Traffic Flow Monitoring,"We propose an algorithm for detecting vehicle positions and their movements by using thermal images obtained through an infrared thermography camera. The proposed algorithm specifies the area of moving vehicles based on the variations of pixel values, i.e. the standard deviations of pixel values along the time direction of spatio-temporal images. It also specifies vehicle positions by applying the pattern recognition algorithm which uses Haar-like features per frame of the images. Moreover, to increase the accuracy of vehicle detection, correction procedures for misrecognition of vehicles are employed. The results of our experiments show that the information about both vehicle positions and their movements can be obtained by combining those two kinds of detection, and the vehicle detection accuracy is 96.3?%. As an application of the algorithm, we also propose a method for estimating traffic flow conditions based on the results obtained by the algorithm. By use of the method for estimating traffic flow conditions, automatic traffic flow monitoring can be achieved. In addition, there is a possibility that traffic accidents, vehicle troubles, and illegal parking can be detected with the proposed method. By using the traffic information obtained from the proposed method, we also expect to realize an optimized traffic signal control around the clock even in changeable weather.",2012
79,Algorithm of Generating Adaptive Background Modeling for crackdown on Illegal Parking,"The Object tracking by real-time image analysis is one of the major concerns in computer vision and its application fields. The Object detection process of real-time images must be preceded before the object tracking process. To achieve the stable object detection performance in the exterior environment, adaptive background model generation methods are needed. The adaptive background model can accept the nature's phenomena changes and adapt the system to the changes such as light or shadow movements that are caused by changes of meridian altitudes of the sun. In this paper, we propose a robust background model generation method effective in an illegal parking auto-detection application area. We also provide a evaluation method that judges whether a moving vehicle stops or not. As the first step, an initial background model is generated. Then the differences between the initial model and the input image frame is used to trace the movement of object. The moving vehicle can be easily recognized from the object tracking process. After that, the model is updated by the background information except the moving object. These steps are repeated. The experiment results show that our background model is effective and adaptable in the variable exterior environment. The results also show our model can detect objects moving slowly. This paper includes the performance evaluation results of the proposed method on the real roads.",2008
80,Illegally Parked Vehicles Detection Based on Omnidirectional Computer Vision,"At present, vision-based illegally parked vehicles detection faces a range of issues such as narrowness of detection range, low detection precision and robustness. This paper proposed a technique for illegally parked vehicles detection. Firstly, Omni-Directional Vision Sensors (ODVS) are used to access Omni-directional images of the scene. Secondly, a method based on two backgrounds modeled by Gaussian mixture model (GMM) with different learning rate is presented. Through simple arithmetic, it is capable to segment temporarily static vehicles in the scene. This method is computational efficient and robust because of the avoidance of a series of complex operations of merging, splitting, entering, leaving, occlusion, and correspondence which are met in traditional methodology depending on object-tracking. Thirdly, shadow suppression is used to overcome the impact of vehicles' own shadow on the detection precision. Experimental results show that the technique can effectively detect illegally parked vehicles with high precision and robustness.",2009
81,Recognizing the Illegal Parking Patterns of Cars on the Road in Front of the Bus Stop Using the Support Vector Machine,"Traffic jams are a major problem in the lives of people in the capital. The occurrence of such problems is due to drivers who do not respect traffic laws, inappropriate behavior of the driver, and the cause of illegal parking at prohibited parking, resulting in the rear car unable to move further. Possible or the car must change lanes to another lane. Therefore, to reduce such problems, we have developed an illegal parking pattern recognition system for cars on the road. We have applied the Support Vector Machine (SVM) to the signal from CCTV cameras and find important characteristics of illegal car parked at the bus stop. Then use those images to learn to recognize the parking behavior of cars with Linear Regression. From the experiment, it is found that the recognition of cars parked on the road in front of the bus stop has an accuracy rate of 82.22 percent which can be used to detect the soaking of personal cars in real life.",2019

84,Intelligent drone-based surveillance: application to parking lot monitoring and detection,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones are rapidly gaining popularity in the field of remote sensing for capturing images with ultra-high spatial resolution while flying at lower altitudes. Development of highlyefficient miniaturized sensors and the use of geospatial image processing techniques have been immensely helpful in growing this technology as the most sought-after and sophisticated remote sensing technique at a relatively lower cost. Parking lot occupancy detection, one of the current drone based application area, can be used for effective management of parking spaces, to reduce queues, minimize the time required to find an area, and to issue tickets in cases of parking violations. Visual information based parking lot monitoring techniques are mostly tailored for specific applications, and they lack generalization. In this paper, a UAV-assisted quick and efficient monitoring solution is proposed for real-time parking occupancy and car number plate detection. In this approach, a drone-mounted camera has been used to capture images of the parking lot under consideration. Initially, the parking lot is being mapped using drone-coordinates, and then a dynamic programming algorithm is used to determine the shortest route to cover multiple parking lots in minimum time to capture maximum number pictures solved by the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). For capturing images, an optimum location is used, such that the drone can cover the maximum area of a parking space in minimum time. Depending on the parking area under investigation, paths altitudes and gimbal angles of the drone is changed dynamically while capturing images. Then a deep neural network based parking lot occupancy monitoring system is used to determine the number of occupied and vacant spots in a parking lot. The drone captured images of each parking spot are then tested with a pre-trained model based on car and non-car images. Then the automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) algorithm is used for parking rule enforcement. Finally, experimental results are verified using a web based application that is connected with a cloud database.",2019

The system is expected to benefit all drivers and the government, and to improve safety and traffic on the roads",2017
86,Social Media Application for Illegal Parking Problem,"Illegal parking is one of the major causes of traffic congestion. Among many ways to mitigate illegal parking, a high level of direct traffic enforcement has been shown to have the strongest impact. Traffic enforcement must invest substantial human resources in patrolling and issuing parking tickets for illegally parked cards.

91,Available car parking space detection from webcam by using adaptive mixing features,"This paper presents a robust approach for detection of available car parking spaces. With low quality of video camera as webcam and dynamic change of light around the car parking, it is hard to accurately detect or recognize the cars. Moreover the proposed appearance-based approach is efficient than recognition-based approach because it do not need to learn a huge of multi-view objects. In this paper, we propose adaptive background model-based object detection with dynamic mixing features of masked-area and edge orientation histogram (EOH) density. The average variance of variance of intensity change for dynamic background model is used to change ratio of mixing features dynamically. The masked-area density is density of predefined area of a parking slot that is weighted by Gaussian mask to robust density computation and the edge orientation histogram (EOH) density is density of the EOH in the predefined area that can be used under low contrast image as night scene. The experiments are performed both in simulation model and real scenes. The results show the proposed approach can handle dynamic change of light efficiently.",2012

94,Proceedings of the International Academic Conference on Frontiers in Social Sciences and Management Innovation,"In recent years, urban management is gradually developing towards informationization. There are corresponding processing mechanisms for illegal billboards and illegal parking in urban management, but the method of detecting illegal billboards based on machine vision is still under study. At present, the automatic detection method of illegal billboards based on machine vision is generally carried out under ideal conditions, and the experiment is carried out under a simple background. This paper takes a street in Hebei Province as the research object, and studies the illegal billboard area under natural conditions, and proposes to use the machine vision-based method to automatically detect the illegal billboards. In the surveillance image, according to the street scene detected by the computer. Image information enables status evaluation of billboard placement. The detection algorithm of this paper uses the multi-angle suggestion area to accurately locate the illegal billboards in the image, and mark the detected billboards. Compared with the direct detection of the billboard in the image, the interference of the background factor on the target area is removed, and the false detection rate is effectively reduced. In billboard detection, this paper proposes an improved region suggestion algorithm to generate higher quality candidate regions in an image for adapting to billboards of various poses under natural conditions. Experimental data shows that the algorithm has good adaptability to the detection of billboards in surveillance images.",2019
95,An Effective Algorithm for Video-Based Parking and Drop Event Detection,"Real-time and accurate detection of parking and dropping events on the road is important for the avoidance of traffic accidents. The existing algorithms for detection require accurate modeling of the background, and most of them use the characteristics of two-dimensional images such as area to distinguish the type of the target. However, these algorithms significantly depend on the background and are lack of accuracy on the type of distinction. Therefore, this paper proposes an algorithm for detecting parking and dropping objects that uses real three-dimensional information to distinguish the type of target. Firstly, an abnormal region is initially defined based on status change, when there is an object that did not exist before in the traffic scene. Secondly, the preliminary determination of the abnormal area is bidirectionally tracked to determine the area of parking and dropping objects, and the eight-neighbor seed filling algorithm is used to segment the parking and the dropping object area. Finally, a three-view recognition method based on inverse projection is proposed to distinguish the parking and dropping objects. The method is based on the matching of the three-dimensional structure of the vehicle body. In addition, the three-dimensional wireframe of the vehicle extracted by the back-projection can be used to match the structural model of the vehicle, and the vehicle model can be further identified. The 3D wireframe of the established vehicle is efficient and can meet the needs of real-time applications. And, based on experimental data collected in tunnels, highways, urban expressways, and rural roads, the proposed algorithm is verified. The results show that the algorithm can effectively detect the parking and dropping objects within different environment, with low miss and false detection rate.",2019
96,Applications of artificial intelligence in real-time video analytics,"Illegal parking can be a ubiquitous concern faced by urban cities, posing potential traffic impediments and safety risks to other road users. Despite having surveillance systems deployed to monitor traffic offences, the videos recorded are often stored only for post-event forensics. Manually inspecting the videos often involves repetitive human labour, which is tedious and prone to errors. In this project, a fully automated pipeline to perform end-to-end illegal parking detection with minimal or no human-in-the-loop was proposed. The pipeline first consists of vehicle detection using a deep learning based object detection algorithm, You Only Look Once Version 3 (YOLOv3), to detect vehicles. Next, movement tracking using template matching and Intersection over Union (IoU) are performed to track the time since the violating vehicle has remained stationary. The last step is to extract the license plate, using OpenALPR, of the violating vehicle which has remained stationary for a defined period. With the fully automated pipeline in place, the dataset can be intelligently leveraged and the analysis can be automated in real-time. Empirical results show high accuracy of vehicle detection and movement tracking module with the license plate detection module achieving a decent performance. However, improvements can be made by retraining its underlying license plate detection and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine with the dataset from the location which the system is to be implemented on.",2019
97,Traffic violation detection and deterrence: Implications for automatic policing,"Current efforts directed at enforcing traffic laws are beset by a dilemma. On the one hand enforcement programmes are limited in duration and intensity, thereby producing weak halo effects on drivers' behaviour. On the other hand, public attitudes towards compliance are largely conditioned by the visibility of enforcement programmes. This paper reviews the impact of the semi-automatic monitoring systems in improving detection in traffic law programmes. The effects of the technology on drivers' behaviour are assessed and implications for the development of a fully automatic traffic policing system are teased out. Secondly, the paper attempts to put into perspective any consequences that an automatic monitoring system may have for driver behaviour. The fact that such systems do not yet exist poses problems for an ergonomics evaluation of their projected impact. However, taking into account the existence of core technology, tentative conclusions can be drawn as to the likely benefits and disadvantages of such systems.",1991

The tracking of the parked vehicle is achieved by key-point extraction of the detected vehicles and feature point matching. For each frame, a bounding box was generated to represent the vehicle and feature points extracted in that area. All parked vehicles have a unique ID which was generated by the Hungarian algorithm and Kalman filter, and the parked vehicle with the same ID was matched frame by frame. Based on this matching result, the stationary vehicles in the forbidden area can be tracked. Our approach tested efficiency and robustness on a public database and is shown to produce state of the art results.",2019
100,Parked Car Detection Method Based on Home Wireless LAN -Using Household Equipment to Detect a Parked Car-,"Consumer-to-consumer (C2C) car park sharing services are now widespread. In these services, space owners rent their unused land, e.g., an unused parking space next to the owner¡¯s home, to a driver. Different from coin parking services, drivers using the park sharing services can make reservations through web sites or mobile-phone applications. There are drivers who abuse this system by, for example, overstaying their reservation. The high cost of parking space sensors that monitor the existence of a parked car makes it cost prohibitive for individuals to install these types of equipment to deter the abuse of parking spaces. To address this problem, we propose a parked car detection technique employing wireless LAN. The proposed method utilizes a household wireless LAN access point and a household laptop computer, and we monitor the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) of beacon frames. This unique method reduces the detection cost and will aid in proliferating car park sharing services. In this paper, we detect the existence of a car in a parking space using the mean and variance of the RSSI. The generated datasets are used for Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and the K-nearest neighbor algorithm (KNN) binary classification. We previously showed that a parked car can be detected when the locations of the equipment are the same. In this study, we show the effect of changing the equipment location in the house on the detection score. These results show that the best recall score is 0.88 and that changing the equipment location does not affect the recall score. The results of this study are expected to be used in a multimodal system.",2020

We propose a methodology for detecting this event in real time by applying a novel image projection that reduces the dimensionality of the data and, thus, reduces the computational complexity of the segmentation and tracking processes. After event detection, we invert the transformation to recover the original appearance of the vehicle and to allow for further processing that may require 2-D data. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm using the i-LIDS vehicle detection challenge datasets as well as videos we have taken ourselves. These videos test the algorithm in a variety of outdoor conditions, including nighttime video and instances of sudden changes in weather.",05-Jun

Illegal vehicles captured by camera are firstly located and classified by the famous Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) algorithm. To improve the performance, we propose to optimize SSD by adjusting the aspect ratio of default box to accommodate with our dataset better.

In the last few years, many abnormal traffic events, such as illegal parking, abandoned objects, speeding, and overloading, have occurred on the highway, threatening traffic safety. In order to distinguish illegal parking and abandoned object events, we propose an effective method to classify these types of abnormal objects. First, abnormal areas are detected by feature point extraction and matching. The transformation relation, between the world and image coordinate systems, is then established by camera calibration. Next, different-height inverse projection planes (IPPs) are built to obtain the inverse projection maps (IPMs). Finally, the 3D information describing the abnormal objects is estimated and used to distinguish illegally parked vehicles and abandoned objects. Experimental results from traffic image sequences show that this method is effective in distinguishing illegal parking and abandoned objects, while its low computational cost satisfies the real-time requirements; furthermore, it can be used in vehicle classification.",2018

Quadstone Paramics is used to incorporate the illegal parking activity into the 9 Toronto Waterfront Network simulation model. Link delay, travel time, speed and link flow along links 10 affected by illegal parking are the measures of effectiveness that reflect the implications of illegal parking in 11 the study. The base case where no illegal parking is simulated is compared with simulations incorporating 12 illegal parking to derive the difference in travel times resulting from illegal parking. It is observed thst on 13 average link delay increases by 50% and link flow reduces by 7% upon introducing illegal on-street parking 14 onto a link",2017
115,Deep Learning-Based Parking Detection System Using Structural Similarity,"High latency of existing vision-based parking detection systems causes significant delay in parking information delivery. The lack of access to real-time outdoor parking information induces the difficulty of finding parking and identifying parking violations, especially in busy downtown areas. Given such backdrop, this research project put forward a deep learning-based parking detection system that accurately detects parking occupancy status and illegal parking on real time basis. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier running on a single board computer is used to classify the occupancy status of parking spaces and identify the presence of illegally parked vehicles. A novel structural similarity (SSIM) decision scheme is introduced to minimize the latency of detecting parking occupancy changes. Multithreading technique is also employed to fully exploit the processing power of single board computer for accelerating illegal parking detection process. The detection results are stored at a cloud-hosted NoSQL database. Two smartphone applications namely Driver App and Enforcer App are developed to channel live parking information for assisting drivers in finding parking and supporting efficient parking enforcement respectively. The proposed parking detection mechanism is implemented and tested at the staff parking area (monitored with an IP camera) of Faculty of Engineering in Multimedia University. Experimental results demonstrated a high accuracy of over 99% in parking occupancy detection and 98.7% precision rate in locating illegal parking incidents with no missed detection under different weather conditions. The implementation of SSIM decision scheme in detecting a single instance of parking occupancy change, managed to accelerate the parking occupancy detection by up to six times faster when compared to a pure CNN classification approach. On the other hand, the incorporation of multithreading mechanism on single board computer increases the computation speed of illegal parking detection in three illegal parking regions by 2.3 times in comparison with sequential execution.",2019
116,A Robust Parking Detection Algorithm Against Electric Railway Magnetic Field Interference,"Wireless magnetic sensor networks (WMSNs) offer an effective and efficient low-cost alternative for real-time parking space monitoring. Current algorithms used for parking space detection based on the WMSNs have been well studied but not without eliminating the geomagnetic field interference. Electric railway systems, such as subways and light rail systems, produce magnetic field radiation that interferes with the geomagnetic field. The electric railway magnetic field interference has increased and is prominent in urban settings; therefore, it is imperative to filter out the interference in order to increase the detection accuracy. This paper proposes an algorithm for parking space detection, which can effectively eliminate the geomagnetic background interference. We solve the parking detection problem through signal filtering technology. Based on mathematical morphology, we designed two filters for extracting morphological structures from interfered magnetic signals. The experimental results verify that the proposed algorithm is more accurate than the existing algorithms.",2020
117,Detection of street-parking vehicles from panoramic street image,"It is important to assess street-parking vehicles causing traffic problems in urban areas, however, it is performed manually and at high cost. It is a top priority for reducing cost, to develop a detection system of those vehicles. We address a spatio-temporal volume and two types of slice surfaces from the volume, and introduce two-types of panoramic street-images, which possibly provide useful information for our daily life. We propose two alternative detection methods, using a laser-range finder and a line-scan camera. In the former detection method, EPI analysis is applied to line-scan images. As a result of verification experiments in real roads, a detection rate reached 76.9%. In the latter detection method, two kinds of cluster analysis are applied to range points: one is for clustering points at each scan, and the other for clustering points over several scans. Each cluster of range points means a vehicle. As a result of verification experiments in real roads, a detection rate reached 90%.",2013
118,Crowdsensing Maps of On-street Parking Spaces,"It has been estimated that traffic congestion costs the world economy hundreds of billions of dollars each year, increases pollution, and has a negative impact on the overall quality of life in metropolitan areas. A significant part of congestion in urban areas is due to vehicles searching for on-street parking. Detailed and accurate on-street parking maps can help drivers easily locate areas with large numbers of legal parking spaces and thus relieve congestion. In this paper, we address the problem of mapping street parking spaces using vehicles' preinstalled parking sensors. In particular, we focus on identifying legal parking spaces from crowdsourced data, whereas earlier work has largely assumed that such maps of legal spaces are given. We demonstrate that crowdsensing data from vehicle parking sensors can be used to classify on-street areas into legal/illegal parking spaces. Based on more than 2 million data points collected in Highland Park, NJ and downtown Brooklyn, NY areas, we show that on-street parking maps can be estimated with an accuracy of ~90% using proposed weighted occupancy rate thresholding algorithm.",2013
119,Attribute Grammar-Based Event Recognition and Anomaly Detection,We propose to use attribute grammars for recognizing normal events and detecting abnormal events in a video. Attribute grammars can describe constraints on features (attributes) in addition to the syntactic structure of the input. Events are recognized using an extension of the Earley parser that handles attributes and concurrent event threads. Abnormal events are detected when the input does not follow syntax of the grammar or the attributes do not satisfy the constraints in the attribute grammar to some degree. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for the task of recognizing normal events and detecting anomalies in a parking lot.,2006

Our country¡¯s law stipulates that there should be no-stop signs and markings, road sections with isolation facilities between motor vehicles and non-motor vehicle lanes and sidewalks, and crosswalks and construction sites. No parking; Railway crossings, sharp bends, narrow roads with widths less than 4 meters, bridges, steep slopes, tunnels, and sections within 50 meters of the above locations are not allowed to stop.

123,Automatic detection of long term parked cars,"The detection of illegal roadside parking is becoming more and more interesting in the field of intelligent transportation systems, since it may cause traffic congestion or accidents. In this paper we propose a method able to analyze videos acquired by traditional surveillance cameras and to automatically detect the vehicles stopped in a forbidden area. Two main contributions have been introduced: first, spatio temporal information related to the stopped vehicles are encoded by a heat map; second, the background is not updated by evaluating the movement of the vehicle in a single time instant, but instead the whole movement of the vehicles, encoded into the heat map, is taken into account. Two widely adopted datasets, namely the iLids and the PETS 2000, have been used to experimentally evaluate the proposed approach and the results achieved, compared with state of the art methodologies, confirm its effectiveness.",2015
124,Vehicle Tracking by Simultaneous Detection and Viewpoint Estimation,"We address the problem of vehicle detection and tracking for traffic monitoring in Smart City applications. We introduce a novel approach for vehicle tracking by simultaneous detection and viewpoint estimation. An Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is adapted to describe the vehicle¡¯s motion when not only the pose of the object is measured, but also its viewpoint with respect to the camera. Specifically, we enhance the motion model with observations of the vehicle viewpoint jointly extracted by the detection step. The approach is evaluated on a novel and challenging dataset with different video sequences recorded at urban environments, which is released with the paper. Our experimental validation confirms that the integration of an EKF with both detections and viewpoint estimations results beneficial.",2013

The parking control surveillance system includes a parking stop having dimensions substantially the same as traditional cement parking stops located at the rear of a parking space. The parking stop includes a video recorder for obtaining images of vehicles entering or exiting the designated parking space. The parking stop further includes a transmitter for transmitting images and information such as the time of parking transgression to vehicle enforcement personnel.,2006

Gaussian mixture model was used to collect the video sequence to realize background modeling. The background difference method was used to obtain the target foreground object and the background update method was also used to reduce the influence of environmental factors on the background model. Through the proposed target centroid method,not only the moving vehicle detection in designated area can be realized but also the illegal parking targets can be identified and alerted. Finally,the results of the experiment which have been done on a certain highway to verify the video sequence of the highway traffic scenes show that the proposed algorithm has the merits of strong scene adaptability,good efficiency and high veracity.",2014

In this area, distributed system based technology like blockchain has been standing out with its decentralization, data-innovation and data transparency. We propose a real-time non-motor vehicle violation detecting approach, which can detect and collect violation information of non-motor vehicle and has been integrated into the distributed smart traffic management system.

128,Vehicle Detection Even in Poor Visibility Conditions Using Infrared Thermal Images and Its Application to Road Traffic Flow Monitoring,"We propose an algorithm for detecting vehicle positions and their movements by using thermal images obtained through an infrared thermography camera. The proposed algorithm specifies the area of moving vehicles based on the variations of pixel values, i.e. the standard deviations of pixel values along the time direction of spatio-temporal images. It also specifies vehicle positions by applying the pattern recognition algorithm which uses Haar-like features per frame of the images. Moreover, to increase the accuracy of vehicle detection, correction procedures for misrecognition of vehicles are employed. The results of our experiments show that the information about both vehicle positions and their movements can be obtained by combining those two kinds of detection, and the vehicle detection accuracy is 96.3?%. As an application of the algorithm, we also propose a method for estimating traffic flow conditions based on the results obtained by the algorithm. By use of the method for estimating traffic flow conditions, automatic traffic flow monitoring can be achieved. In addition, there is a possibility that traffic accidents, vehicle troubles, and illegal parking can be detected with the proposed method. By using the traffic information obtained from the proposed method, we also expect to realize an optimized traffic signal control around the clock even in changeable weather.",2012
129,Algorithm of Generating Adaptive Background Modeling for crackdown on Illegal Parking,"The Object tracking by real-time image analysis is one of the major concerns in computer vision and its application fields. The Object detection process of real-time images must be preceded before the object tracking process. To achieve the stable object detection performance in the exterior environment, adaptive background model generation methods are needed. The adaptive background model can accept the nature's phenomena changes and adapt the system to the changes such as light or shadow movements that are caused by changes of meridian altitudes of the sun. In this paper, we propose a robust background model generation method effective in an illegal parking auto-detection application area. We also provide a evaluation method that judges whether a moving vehicle stops or not. As the first step, an initial background model is generated. Then the differences between the initial model and the input image frame is used to trace the movement of object. The moving vehicle can be easily recognized from the object tracking process. After that, the model is updated by the background information except the moving object. These steps are repeated. The experiment results show that our background model is effective and adaptable in the variable exterior environment. The results also show our model can detect objects moving slowly. This paper includes the performance evaluation results of the proposed method on the real roads.",2008
130,Illegally Parked Vehicles Detection Based on Omnidirectional Computer Vision,"At present, vision-based illegally parked vehicles detection faces a range of issues such as narrowness of detection range, low detection precision and robustness. This paper proposed a technique for illegally parked vehicles detection. Firstly, Omni-Directional Vision Sensors (ODVS) are used to access Omni-directional images of the scene. Secondly, a method based on two backgrounds modeled by Gaussian mixture model (GMM) with different learning rate is presented. Through simple arithmetic, it is capable to segment temporarily static vehicles in the scene. This method is computational efficient and robust because of the avoidance of a series of complex operations of merging, splitting, entering, leaving, occlusion, and correspondence which are met in traditional methodology depending on object-tracking. Thirdly, shadow suppression is used to overcome the impact of vehicles' own shadow on the detection precision. Experimental results show that the technique can effectively detect illegally parked vehicles with high precision and robustness.",2009
131,Recognizing the Illegal Parking Patterns of Cars on the Road in Front of the Bus Stop Using the Support Vector Machine,"Traffic jams are a major problem in the lives of people in the capital. The occurrence of such problems is due to drivers who do not respect traffic laws, inappropriate behavior of the driver, and the cause of illegal parking at prohibited parking, resulting in the rear car unable to move further. Possible or the car must change lanes to another lane. Therefore, to reduce such problems, we have developed an illegal parking pattern recognition system for cars on the road. We have applied the Support Vector Machine (SVM) to the signal from CCTV cameras and find important characteristics of illegal car parked at the bus stop. Then use those images to learn to recognize the parking behavior of cars with Linear Regression. From the experiment, it is found that the recognition of cars parked on the road in front of the bus stop has an accuracy rate of 82.22 percent which can be used to detect the soaking of personal cars in real life.",2019

The determination of the heights and lengths are carried out by comparing the maximum height for a set of vehicles. The system was implemented using MATLAB and the developed technique was tested for accuracy considering various classes of vehicles. For ease of implementation, the system incorporates a camera mounted on a flat surface with fixed pixel setting.",2015

134,Intelligent drone-based surveillance: application to parking lot monitoring and detection,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones are rapidly gaining popularity in the field of remote sensing for capturing images with ultra-high spatial resolution while flying at lower altitudes. Development of highlyefficient miniaturized sensors and the use of geospatial image processing techniques have been immensely helpful in growing this technology as the most sought-after and sophisticated remote sensing technique at a relatively lower cost. Parking lot occupancy detection, one of the current drone based application area, can be used for effective management of parking spaces, to reduce queues, minimize the time required to find an area, and to issue tickets in cases of parking violations. Visual information based parking lot monitoring techniques are mostly tailored for specific applications, and they lack generalization. In this paper, a UAV-assisted quick and efficient monitoring solution is proposed for real-time parking occupancy and car number plate detection. In this approach, a drone-mounted camera has been used to capture images of the parking lot under consideration. Initially, the parking lot is being mapped using drone-coordinates, and then a dynamic programming algorithm is used to determine the shortest route to cover multiple parking lots in minimum time to capture maximum number pictures solved by the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). For capturing images, an optimum location is used, such that the drone can cover the maximum area of a parking space in minimum time. Depending on the parking area under investigation, paths altitudes and gimbal angles of the drone is changed dynamically while capturing images. Then a deep neural network based parking lot occupancy monitoring system is used to determine the number of occupied and vacant spots in a parking lot. The drone captured images of each parking spot are then tested with a pre-trained model based on car and non-car images. Then the automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) algorithm is used for parking rule enforcement. Finally, experimental results are verified using a web based application that is connected with a cloud database.",2019

The system is expected to benefit all drivers and the government, and to improve safety and traffic on the roads",2017
136,Social Media Application for Illegal Parking Problem,"Illegal parking is one of the major causes of traffic congestion. Among many ways to mitigate illegal parking, a high level of direct traffic enforcement has been shown to have the strongest impact. Traffic enforcement must invest substantial human resources in patrolling and issuing parking tickets for illegally parked cards. The work load is overwhelming and efficiency is low since the illegal parking occurs almost everywhere in urban areas. This study tries to help traffic related officers ease their work load but minimize illegal parking by implementing social media networking. Social media in China has a significant number of users which covers nearly every urban area so that the service users can be public police officers to make traffic flow better in the city. The aim of this research is to develop the smartphone-based application and see its possible potential.

141,Available car parking space detection from webcam by using adaptive mixing features,"This paper presents a robust approach for detection of available car parking spaces. With low quality of video camera as webcam and dynamic change of light around the car parking, it is hard to accurately detect or recognize the cars. Moreover the proposed appearance-based approach is efficient than recognition-based approach because it do not need to learn a huge of multi-view objects. In this paper, we propose adaptive background model-based object detection with dynamic mixing features of masked-area and edge orientation histogram (EOH) density. The average variance of variance of intensity change for dynamic background model is used to change ratio of mixing features dynamically. The masked-area density is density of predefined area of a parking slot that is weighted by Gaussian mask to robust density computation and the edge orientation histogram (EOH) density is density of the EOH in the predefined area that can be used under low contrast image as night scene.

144,Proceedings of the International Academic Conference on Frontiers in Social Sciences and Management Innovation,"In recent years, urban management is gradually developing towards informationization. There are corresponding processing mechanisms for illegal billboards and illegal parking in urban management, but the method of detecting illegal billboards based on machine vision is still under study. At present, the automatic detection method of illegal billboards based on machine vision is generally carried out under ideal conditions, and the experiment is carried out under a simple background. This paper takes a street in Hebei Province as the research object, and studies the illegal billboard area under natural conditions, and proposes to use the machine vision-based method to automatically detect the illegal billboards. In the surveillance image, according to the street scene detected by the computer. Image information enables status evaluation of billboard placement. The detection algorithm of this paper uses the multi-angle suggestion area to accurately locate the illegal billboards in the image, and mark the detected billboards. Compared with the direct detection of the billboard in the image, the interference of the background factor on the target area is removed, and the false detection rate is effectively reduced. In billboard detection, this paper proposes an improved region suggestion algorithm to generate higher quality candidate regions in an image for adapting to billboards of various poses under natural conditions. Experimental data shows that the algorithm has good adaptability to the detection of billboards in surveillance images.",2019
145,An Effective Algorithm for Video-Based Parking and Drop Event Detection,"Real-time and accurate detection of parking and dropping events on the road is important for the avoidance of traffic accidents. The existing algorithms for detection require accurate modeling of the background, and most of them use the characteristics of two-dimensional images such as area to distinguish the type of the target. However, these algorithms significantly depend on the background and are lack of accuracy on the type of distinction. Therefore, this paper proposes an algorithm for detecting parking and dropping objects that uses real three-dimensional information to distinguish the type of target. Firstly, an abnormal region is initially defined based on status change, when there is an object that did not exist before in the traffic scene. Secondly, the preliminary determination of the abnormal area is bidirectionally tracked to determine the area of parking and dropping objects, and the eight-neighbor seed filling algorithm is used to segment the parking and the dropping object area. Finally, a three-view recognition method based on inverse projection is proposed to distinguish the parking and dropping objects. The method is based on the matching of the three-dimensional structure of the vehicle body. In addition, the three-dimensional wireframe of the vehicle extracted by the back-projection can be used to match the structural model of the vehicle, and the vehicle model can be further identified. The 3D wireframe of the established vehicle is efficient and can meet the needs of real-time applications. And, based on experimental data collected in tunnels, highways, urban expressways, and rural roads, the proposed algorithm is verified. The results show that the algorithm can effectively detect the parking and dropping objects within different environment, with low miss and false detection rate.",2019
146,Applications of artificial intelligence in real-time video analytics,"Illegal parking can be a ubiquitous concern faced by urban cities, posing potential traffic impediments and safety risks to other road users. Despite having surveillance systems deployed to monitor traffic offences, the videos recorded are often stored only for post-event forensics. Manually inspecting the videos often involves repetitive human labour, which is tedious and prone to errors. In this project, a fully automated pipeline to perform end-to-end illegal parking detection with minimal or no human-in-the-loop was proposed. The pipeline first consists of vehicle detection using a deep learning based object detection algorithm, You Only Look Once Version 3 (YOLOv3), to detect vehicles. Next, movement tracking using template matching and Intersection over Union (IoU) are performed to track the time since the violating vehicle has remained stationary. The last step is to extract the license plate, using OpenALPR, of the violating vehicle which has remained stationary for a defined period. With the fully automated pipeline in place, the dataset can be intelligently leveraged and the analysis can be automated in real-time. Empirical results show high accuracy of vehicle detection and movement tracking module with the license plate detection module achieving a decent performance. However, improvements can be made by retraining its underlying license plate detection and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine with the dataset from the location which the system is to be implemented on.",2019
147,Traffic violation detection and deterrence: Implications for automatic policing,"Current efforts directed at enforcing traffic laws are beset by a dilemma. On the one hand enforcement programmes are limited in duration and intensity, thereby producing weak halo effects on drivers' behaviour. On the other hand, public attitudes towards compliance are largely conditioned by the visibility of enforcement programmes. This paper reviews the impact of the semi-automatic monitoring systems in improving detection in traffic law programmes. The effects of the technology on drivers' behaviour are assessed and implications for the development of a fully automatic traffic policing system are teased out. Secondly, the paper attempts to put into perspective any consequences that an automatic monitoring system may have for driver behaviour. The fact that such systems do not yet exist poses problems for an ergonomics evaluation of their projected impact. However, taking into account the existence of core technology, tentative conclusions can be drawn as to the likely benefits and disadvantages of such systems.",1991

This approach is based on deep learning for vehicles detection and hand crafted descriptors for the tracking which are designed to cope with occlusions. The tracking of the parked vehicle is achieved by key-point extraction of the detected vehicles and feature point matching. For each frame, a bounding box was generated to represent the vehicle and feature points extracted in that area. All parked vehicles have a unique ID which was generated by the Hungarian algorithm and Kalman filter, and the parked vehicle with the same ID was matched frame by frame. Based on this matching result, the stationary vehicles in the forbidden area can be tracked. Our approach tested efficiency and robustness on a public database and is shown to produce state of the art results.",2019
150,Parked Car Detection Method Based on Home Wireless LAN -Using Household Equipment to Detect a Parked Car-,"Consumer-to-consumer (C2C) car park sharing services are now widespread.

Different from coin parking services, drivers using the park sharing services can make reservations through web sites or mobile-phone applications. There are drivers who abuse this system by, for example, overstaying their reservation. The high cost of parking space sensors that monitor the existence of a parked car makes it cost prohibitive for individuals to install these types of equipment to deter the abuse of parking spaces. To address this problem, we propose a parked car detection technique employing wireless LAN. The proposed method utilizes a household wireless LAN access point and a household laptop computer, and we monitor the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) of beacon frames. This unique method reduces the detection cost and will aid in proliferating car park sharing services. In this paper, we detect the existence of a car in a parking space using the mean and variance of the RSSI. The generated datasets are used for Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and the K-nearest neighbor algorithm (KNN) binary classification. We previously showed that a parked car can be detected when the locations of the equipment are the same. In this study, we show the effect of changing the equipment location in the house on the detection score. These results show that the best recall score is 0.88 and that changing the equipment location does not affect the recall score. The results of this study are expected to be used in a multimodal system.",2020
151,Real-Time Illegal Parking Detection in Outdoor Environments Using 1-D Transformation,"With decreasing costs of high-quality surveillance systems, human activity detection and tracking has become increasingly practical. Accordingly, automated systems have been designed for numerous detection tasks, but the task of detecting illegally parked vehicles has been left largely to the human operators of surveillance systems. We propose a methodology for detecting this event in real time by applying a novel image projection that reduces the dimensionality of the data and, thus, reduces the computational complexity of the segmentation and tracking processes. After event detection, we invert the transformation to recover the original appearance of the vehicle and to allow for further processing that may require 2-D data. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm using the i-LIDS vehicle detection challenge datasets as well as videos we have taken ourselves. These videos test the algorithm in a variety of outdoor conditions, including nighttime video and instances of sudden changes in weather.",05-Jun
152,Real-Time Illegal Parking Detection System Based on Deep Learning,"The increasing illegal parking has become more and more serious. Nowadays the methods of detecting illegally parked vehicles are based on background segmentation. However, this method is weakly robust and sensitive to environment. Benefitting from deep learning, this paper proposes a novel illegal vehicle parking detection system. Illegal vehicles captured by camera are firstly located and classified by the famous Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) algorithm. To improve the performance, we propose to optimize SSD by adjusting the aspect ratio of default box to accommodate with our dataset better. After that, a tracking and analysis of movement is adopted to judge the illegal vehicles in the region of interest (ROI). Experiments show that the system can achieve a 99% accuracy and real-time (25FPS) detection with strong robustness in complex environments.",05-Jul

155,A Deep Learning based Illegal Parking Detection Platform,"Illegal parking is a critical problem in large, growing cities. Currently, the responsibility for detecting illegally parked vehicles has been left to law enforcement, which often requires manual inspection.

This proposed platform provides an algorithm to improve the performance of detecting vehicle license plates from videos, based on an existing deep learning approach. Also, we provide a method to estimate vehicle parking locations. This platform is applicable for videos of security patrolling. End-users can define restricted zones via a map-based interface and all vehicles located in these areas can be efficiently identified once patrolling videos are received. This system is evaluated by two videos captured in real-world parking lots. The results indicate that the proposed platform can successfully identify vehicle plate numbers and estimate their parking locations to support the management of urban parking infrastructure.",05-Jul

158,Multi-Vehicle Tracking Based Traffic Illegal Parking Detection,"Vehicle detection and tracking are the foundations of traffic violation punishment. The current methods have more parameters to be adjusted and can not adapt to the complex traffic scenes. For the purpose of practice application, we propose an illegal parking detection algorithm based on vehicle tracking theory. In order to filter the dynamic interferences such as vehicles parking for a long time, moving vehicles overlapping, and the vehicle losing momentarily from the video, a Gaussian mixture model is combined with the correlations among adjacent pixels to update background and eliminate noises. In allusion to complex traffic scenes, a fast multi-object tracking algorithm is presented to track occluded vehicles effectively.

163,Novel Discriminative Method for Illegal Parking and Abandoned Objects,"Computer vision techniques have been widely applied in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) to automatically detect abnormal events and trigger alarms. In the last few years, many abnormal traffic events, such as illegal parking, abandoned objects, speeding, and overloading, have occurred on the highway, threatening traffic safety. In order to distinguish illegal parking and abandoned object events, we propose an effective method to classify these types of abnormal objects. First, abnormal areas are detected by feature point extraction and matching. The transformation relation, between the world and image coordinate systems, is then established by camera calibration. Next, different-height inverse projection planes (IPPs) are built to obtain the inverse projection maps (IPMs). Finally, the 3D information describing the abnormal objects is estimated and used to distinguish illegally parked vehicles and abandoned objects. Experimental results from traffic image sequences show that this method is effective in distinguishing illegal parking and abandoned objects, while its low computational cost satisfies the real-time requirements; furthermore, it can be used in vehicle classification.",2018
164,AN INTEGRATED TRAFFIC MICROSIMULATION MODEL OF ILLEGAL ON-STREET PARKING IN DOWNTOWN TORONTO,"On-street parking involves the blockage of the lane on which a vehicle parks, thus reducing its capacity. As 3 a result, large cities such as the city of Toronto restrict on-street parking on main routes during traffic peak 4 periods. As with any parking restriction, the compliance rate to this policy is not a 100%. This study aims to 5 use Traffic Microsimulation to quantify the impact of illegal on-street parking during the AM peak period 6 on the level of congestion in the city of Toronto. The study uses traffic demands and parking citation data 7 from the year 2011 to simulate existing traffic conditions and reflect the existing level of incompliance to 8 the on-street parking policy. Quadstone Paramics is used to incorporate the illegal parking activity into the 9 Toronto Waterfront Network simulation model. Link delay, travel time, speed and link flow along links 10 affected by illegal parking are the measures of effectiveness that reflect the implications of illegal parking in 11 the study. The base case where no illegal parking is simulated is compared with simulations incorporating 12 illegal parking to derive the difference in travel times resulting from illegal parking.

165,Deep Learning-Based Parking Detection System Using Structural Similarity,"High latency of existing vision-based parking detection systems causes significant delay in parking information delivery. The lack of access to real-time outdoor parking information induces the difficulty of finding parking and identifying parking violations, especially in busy downtown areas. Given such backdrop, this research project put forward a deep learning-based parking detection system that accurately detects parking occupancy status and illegal parking on real time basis. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier running on a single board computer is used to classify the occupancy status of parking spaces and identify the presence of illegally parked vehicles. A novel structural similarity (SSIM) decision scheme is introduced to minimize the latency of detecting parking occupancy changes. Multithreading technique is also employed to fully exploit the processing power of single board computer for accelerating illegal parking detection process. The detection results are stored at a cloud-hosted NoSQL database. Two smartphone applications namely Driver App and Enforcer App are developed to channel live parking information for assisting drivers in finding parking and supporting efficient parking enforcement respectively. The proposed parking detection mechanism is implemented and tested at the staff parking area (monitored with an IP camera) of Faculty of Engineering in Multimedia University. Experimental results demonstrated a high accuracy of over 99% in parking occupancy detection and 98.7% precision rate in locating illegal parking incidents with no missed detection under different weather conditions. The implementation of SSIM decision scheme in detecting a single instance of parking occupancy change, managed to accelerate the parking occupancy detection by up to six times faster when compared to a pure CNN classification approach. On the other hand, the incorporation of multithreading mechanism on single board computer increases the computation speed of illegal parking detection in three illegal parking regions by 2.3 times in comparison with sequential execution.",2019
166,A Robust Parking Detection Algorithm Against Electric Railway Magnetic Field Interference,"Wireless magnetic sensor networks (WMSNs) offer an effective and efficient low-cost alternative for real-time parking space monitoring. Current algorithms used for parking space detection based on the WMSNs have been well studied but not without eliminating the geomagnetic field interference. Electric railway systems, such as subways and light rail systems, produce magnetic field radiation that interferes with the geomagnetic field. The electric railway magnetic field interference has increased and is prominent in urban settings; therefore, it is imperative to filter out the interference in order to increase the detection accuracy. This paper proposes an algorithm for parking space detection, which can effectively eliminate the geomagnetic background interference. We solve the parking detection problem through signal filtering technology. Based on mathematical morphology, we designed two filters for extracting morphological structures from interfered magnetic signals. The experimental results verify that the proposed algorithm is more accurate than the existing algorithms.",2020

As a result of verification experiments in real roads, a detection rate reached 76.9%. In the latter detection method, two kinds of cluster analysis are applied to range points: one is for clustering points at each scan, and the other for clustering points over several scans. Each cluster of range points means a vehicle. As a result of verification experiments in real roads, a detection rate reached 90%.",2013
168,Crowdsensing Maps of On-street Parking Spaces,"It has been estimated that traffic congestion costs the world economy hundreds of billions of dollars each year, increases pollution, and has a negative impact on the overall quality of life in metropolitan areas. A significant part of congestion in urban areas is due to vehicles searching for on-street parking. Detailed and accurate on-street parking maps can help drivers easily locate areas with large numbers of legal parking spaces and thus relieve congestion. In this paper, we address the problem of mapping street parking spaces using vehicles' preinstalled parking sensors. In particular, we focus on identifying legal parking spaces from crowdsourced data, whereas earlier work has largely assumed that such maps of legal spaces are given. We demonstrate that crowdsensing data from vehicle parking sensors can be used to classify on-street areas into legal/illegal parking spaces. Based on more than 2 million data points collected in Highland Park, NJ and downtown Brooklyn, NY areas, we show that on-street parking maps can be estimated with an accuracy of ~90% using proposed weighted occupancy rate thresholding algorithm.",2013
169,Attribute Grammar-Based Event Recognition and Anomaly Detection,We propose to use attribute grammars for recognizing normal events and detecting abnormal events in a video. Attribute grammars can describe constraints on features (attributes) in addition to the syntactic structure of the input. Events are recognized using an extension of the Earley parser that handles attributes and concurrent event threads. Abnormal events are detected when the input does not follow syntax of the grammar or the attributes do not satisfy the constraints in the attribute grammar to some degree. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for the task of recognizing normal events and detecting anomalies in a parking lot.,2006

Two main contributions have been introduced: first, spatio temporal information related to the stopped vehicles are encoded by a heat map; second, the background is not updated by evaluating the movement of the vehicle in a single time instant, but instead the whole movement of the vehicles, encoded into the heat map, is taken into account.

178,Vehicle Detection Even in Poor Visibility Conditions Using Infrared Thermal Images and Its Application to Road Traffic Flow Monitoring,"We propose an algorithm for detecting vehicle positions and their movements by using thermal images obtained through an infrared thermography camera. The proposed algorithm specifies the area of moving vehicles based on the variations of pixel values, i.e. the standard deviations of pixel values along the time direction of spatio-temporal images. It also specifies vehicle positions by applying the pattern recognition algorithm which uses Haar-like features per frame of the images. Moreover, to increase the accuracy of vehicle detection, correction procedures for misrecognition of vehicles are employed. The results of our experiments show that the information about both vehicle positions and their movements can be obtained by combining those two kinds of detection, and the vehicle detection accuracy is 96.3?%. As an application of the algorithm, we also propose a method for estimating traffic flow conditions based on the results obtained by the algorithm. By use of the method for estimating traffic flow conditions, automatic traffic flow monitoring can be achieved. In addition, there is a possibility that traffic accidents, vehicle troubles, and illegal parking can be detected with the proposed method. By using the traffic information obtained from the proposed method, we also expect to realize an optimized traffic signal control around the clock even in changeable weather.",2012
179,Algorithm of Generating Adaptive Background Modeling for crackdown on Illegal Parking,"The Object tracking by real-time image analysis is one of the major concerns in computer vision and its application fields. The Object detection process of real-time images must be preceded before the object tracking process. To achieve the stable object detection performance in the exterior environment, adaptive background model generation methods are needed. The adaptive background model can accept the nature's phenomena changes and adapt the system to the changes such as light or shadow movements that are caused by changes of meridian altitudes of the sun. In this paper, we propose a robust background model generation method effective in an illegal parking auto-detection application area. We also provide a evaluation method that judges whether a moving vehicle stops or not. As the first step, an initial background model is generated. Then the differences between the initial model and the input image frame is used to trace the movement of object. The moving vehicle can be easily recognized from the object tracking process. After that, the model is updated by the background information except the moving object. These steps are repeated. The experiment results show that our background model is effective and adaptable in the variable exterior environment. The results also show our model can detect objects moving slowly.

Secondly, a method based on two backgrounds modeled by Gaussian mixture model (GMM) with different learning rate is presented. Through simple arithmetic, it is capable to segment temporarily static vehicles in the scene. This method is computational efficient and robust because of the avoidance of a series of complex operations of merging, splitting, entering, leaving, occlusion, and correspondence which are met in traditional methodology depending on object-tracking. Thirdly, shadow suppression is used to overcome the impact of vehicles' own shadow on the detection precision. Experimental results show that the technique can effectively detect illegally parked vehicles with high precision and robustness.",2009
181,Recognizing the Illegal Parking Patterns of Cars on the Road in Front of the Bus Stop Using the Support Vector Machine,"Traffic jams are a major problem in the lives of people in the capital. The occurrence of such problems is due to drivers who do not respect traffic laws, inappropriate behavior of the driver, and the cause of illegal parking at prohibited parking, resulting in the rear car unable to move further. Possible or the car must change lanes to another lane. Therefore, to reduce such problems, we have developed an illegal parking pattern recognition system for cars on the road. We have applied the Support Vector Machine (SVM) to the signal from CCTV cameras and find important characteristics of illegal car parked at the bus stop. Then use those images to learn to recognize the parking behavior of cars with Linear Regression.

184,Intelligent drone-based surveillance: application to parking lot monitoring and detection,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones are rapidly gaining popularity in the field of remote sensing for capturing images with ultra-high spatial resolution while flying at lower altitudes. Development of highlyefficient miniaturized sensors and the use of geospatial image processing techniques have been immensely helpful in growing this technology as the most sought-after and sophisticated remote sensing technique at a relatively lower cost. Parking lot occupancy detection, one of the current drone based application area, can be used for effective management of parking spaces, to reduce queues, minimize the time required to find an area, and to issue tickets in cases of parking violations. Visual information based parking lot monitoring techniques are mostly tailored for specific applications, and they lack generalization. In this paper, a UAV-assisted quick and efficient monitoring solution is proposed for real-time parking occupancy and car number plate detection. In this approach, a drone-mounted camera has been used to capture images of the parking lot under consideration. Initially, the parking lot is being mapped using drone-coordinates, and then a dynamic programming algorithm is used to determine the shortest route to cover multiple parking lots in minimum time to capture maximum number pictures solved by the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). For capturing images, an optimum location is used, such that the drone can cover the maximum area of a parking space in minimum time. Depending on the parking area under investigation, paths altitudes and gimbal angles of the drone is changed dynamically while capturing images. Then a deep neural network based parking lot occupancy monitoring system is used to determine the number of occupied and vacant spots in a parking lot. The drone captured images of each parking spot are then tested with a pre-trained model based on car and non-car images. Then the automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) algorithm is used for parking rule enforcement. Finally, experimental results are verified using a web based application that is connected with a cloud database.",2019

The system is expected to benefit all drivers and the government, and to improve safety and traffic on the roads",2017
186,Social Media Application for Illegal Parking Problem,"Illegal parking is one of the major causes of traffic congestion. Among many ways to mitigate illegal parking, a high level of direct traffic enforcement has been shown to have the strongest impact. Traffic enforcement must invest substantial human resources in patrolling and issuing parking tickets for illegally parked cards.

In order to control this non-standard parked behavior, orderly and reasonable guide and regulate owners to develop good parking habits, we design a vehicle parking violation notification system. A system is designed in the article to record illegal parking information of vehicles.

191,Available car parking space detection from webcam by using adaptive mixing features,"This paper presents a robust approach for detection of available car parking spaces. With low quality of video camera as webcam and dynamic change of light around the car parking, it is hard to accurately detect or recognize the cars. Moreover the proposed appearance-based approach is efficient than recognition-based approach because it do not need to learn a huge of multi-view objects. In this paper, we propose adaptive background model-based object detection with dynamic mixing features of masked-area and edge orientation histogram (EOH) density. The average variance of variance of intensity change for dynamic background model is used to change ratio of mixing features dynamically. The masked-area density is density of predefined area of a parking slot that is weighted by Gaussian mask to robust density computation and the edge orientation histogram (EOH) density is density of the EOH in the predefined area that can be used under low contrast image as night scene. The experiments are performed both in simulation model and real scenes. The results show the proposed approach can handle dynamic change of light efficiently.",2012

194,Proceedings of the International Academic Conference on Frontiers in Social Sciences and Management Innovation,"In recent years, urban management is gradually developing towards informationization. There are corresponding processing mechanisms for illegal billboards and illegal parking in urban management, but the method of detecting illegal billboards based on machine vision is still under study. At present, the automatic detection method of illegal billboards based on machine vision is generally carried out under ideal conditions, and the experiment is carried out under a simple background. This paper takes a street in Hebei Province as the research object, and studies the illegal billboard area under natural conditions, and proposes to use the machine vision-based method to automatically detect the illegal billboards. In the surveillance image, according to the street scene detected by the computer. Image information enables status evaluation of billboard placement. The detection algorithm of this paper uses the multi-angle suggestion area to accurately locate the illegal billboards in the image, and mark the detected billboards. Compared with the direct detection of the billboard in the image, the interference of the background factor on the target area is removed, and the false detection rate is effectively reduced. In billboard detection, this paper proposes an improved region suggestion algorithm to generate higher quality candidate regions in an image for adapting to billboards of various poses under natural conditions. Experimental data shows that the algorithm has good adaptability to the detection of billboards in surveillance images.",2019
195,An Effective Algorithm for Video-Based Parking and Drop Event Detection,"Real-time and accurate detection of parking and dropping events on the road is important for the avoidance of traffic accidents. The existing algorithms for detection require accurate modeling of the background, and most of them use the characteristics of two-dimensional images such as area to distinguish the type of the target. However, these algorithms significantly depend on the background and are lack of accuracy on the type of distinction. Therefore, this paper proposes an algorithm for detecting parking and dropping objects that uses real three-dimensional information to distinguish the type of target. Firstly, an abnormal region is initially defined based on status change, when there is an object that did not exist before in the traffic scene. Secondly, the preliminary determination of the abnormal area is bidirectionally tracked to determine the area of parking and dropping objects, and the eight-neighbor seed filling algorithm is used to segment the parking and the dropping object area. Finally, a three-view recognition method based on inverse projection is proposed to distinguish the parking and dropping objects. The method is based on the matching of the three-dimensional structure of the vehicle body. In addition, the three-dimensional wireframe of the vehicle extracted by the back-projection can be used to match the structural model of the vehicle, and the vehicle model can be further identified. The 3D wireframe of the established vehicle is efficient and can meet the needs of real-time applications. And, based on experimental data collected in tunnels, highways, urban expressways, and rural roads, the proposed algorithm is verified. The results show that the algorithm can effectively detect the parking and dropping objects within different environment, with low miss and false detection rate.",2019
196,Applications of artificial intelligence in real-time video analytics,"Illegal parking can be a ubiquitous concern faced by urban cities, posing potential traffic impediments and safety risks to other road users. Despite having surveillance systems deployed to monitor traffic offences, the videos recorded are often stored only for post-event forensics. Manually inspecting the videos often involves repetitive human labour, which is tedious and prone to errors. In this project, a fully automated pipeline to perform end-to-end illegal parking detection with minimal or no human-in-the-loop was proposed. The pipeline first consists of vehicle detection using a deep learning based object detection algorithm, You Only Look Once Version 3 (YOLOv3), to detect vehicles. Next, movement tracking using template matching and Intersection over Union (IoU) are performed to track the time since the violating vehicle has remained stationary. The last step is to extract the license plate, using OpenALPR, of the violating vehicle which has remained stationary for a defined period. With the fully automated pipeline in place, the dataset can be intelligently leveraged and the analysis can be automated in real-time. Empirical results show high accuracy of vehicle detection and movement tracking module with the license plate detection module achieving a decent performance. However, improvements can be made by retraining its underlying license plate detection and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine with the dataset from the location which the system is to be implemented on.",2019
197,Traffic violation detection and deterrence: Implications for automatic policing,"Current efforts directed at enforcing traffic laws are beset by a dilemma. On the one hand enforcement programmes are limited in duration and intensity, thereby producing weak halo effects on drivers' behaviour. On the other hand, public attitudes towards compliance are largely conditioned by the visibility of enforcement programmes. This paper reviews the impact of the semi-automatic monitoring systems in improving detection in traffic law programmes. The effects of the technology on drivers' behaviour are assessed and implications for the development of a fully automatic traffic policing system are teased out. Secondly, the paper attempts to put into perspective any consequences that an automatic monitoring system may have for driver behaviour. The fact that such systems do not yet exist poses problems for an ergonomics evaluation of their projected impact. However, taking into account the existence of core technology, tentative conclusions can be drawn as to the likely benefits and disadvantages of such systems.",1991

The purpose of this integrated system is to provide a method to identify different types of traffic violations and to reduce the number of systems used to record violations. This method receives input from traffic surveillance camera and uses DNN to classify the vehicles to reduce the number of personnel needed to do this manually.

199,Illegally Parked Vehicle Detection using Deep Learning and Key-point Tracking,"In this paper, we present a method for identifying and tracking illegally parked vehicles. This approach is based on deep learning for vehicles detection and hand crafted descriptors for the tracking which are designed to cope with occlusions. The tracking of the parked vehicle is achieved by key-point extraction of the detected vehicles and feature point matching. For each frame, a bounding box was generated to represent the vehicle and feature points extracted in that area. All parked vehicles have a unique ID which was generated by the Hungarian algorithm and Kalman filter, and the parked vehicle with the same ID was matched frame by frame. Based on this matching result, the stationary vehicles in the forbidden area can be tracked. Our approach tested efficiency and robustness on a public database and is shown to produce state of the art results.",2019
200,Parked Car Detection Method Based on Home Wireless LAN -Using Household Equipment to Detect a Parked Car-,"Consumer-to-consumer (C2C) car park sharing services are now widespread. In these services, space owners rent their unused land, e.g., an unused parking space next to the owner¡¯s home, to a driver. Different from coin parking services, drivers using the park sharing services can make reservations through web sites or mobile-phone applications. There are drivers who abuse this system by, for example, overstaying their reservation. The high cost of parking space sensors that monitor the existence of a parked car makes it cost prohibitive for individuals to install these types of equipment to deter the abuse of parking spaces. To address this problem, we propose a parked car detection technique employing wireless LAN. The proposed method utilizes a household wireless LAN access point and a household laptop computer, and we monitor the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) of beacon frames. This unique method reduces the detection cost and will aid in proliferating car park sharing services. In this paper, we detect the existence of a car in a parking space using the mean and variance of the RSSI. The generated datasets are used for Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and the K-nearest neighbor algorithm (KNN) binary classification. We previously showed that a parked car can be detected when the locations of the equipment are the same. In this study, we show the effect of changing the equipment location in the house on the detection score. These results show that the best recall score is 0.88 and that changing the equipment location does not affect the recall score. The results of this study are expected to be used in a multimodal system.",2020

Accordingly, automated systems have been designed for numerous detection tasks, but the task of detecting illegally parked vehicles has been left largely to the human operators of surveillance systems. We propose a methodology for detecting this event in real time by applying a novel image projection that reduces the dimensionality of the data and, thus, reduces the computational complexity of the segmentation and tracking processes. After event detection, we invert the transformation to recover the original appearance of the vehicle and to allow for further processing that may require 2-D data. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm using the i-LIDS vehicle detection challenge datasets as well as videos we have taken ourselves. These videos test the algorithm in a variety of outdoor conditions, including nighttime video and instances of sudden changes in weather.",05-Jun
202,Real-Time Illegal Parking Detection System Based on Deep Learning,"The increasing illegal parking has become more and more serious. Nowadays the methods of detecting illegally parked vehicles are based on background segmentation. However, this method is weakly robust and sensitive to environment. Benefitting from deep learning, this paper proposes a novel illegal vehicle parking detection system. Illegal vehicles captured by camera are firstly located and classified by the famous Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) algorithm. To improve the performance, we propose to optimize SSD by adjusting the aspect ratio of default box to accommodate with our dataset better. After that, a tracking and analysis of movement is adopted to judge the illegal vehicles in the region of interest (ROI). Experiments show that the system can achieve a 99% accuracy and real-time (25FPS) detection with strong robustness in complex environments.",05-Jul

205,A Deep Learning based Illegal Parking Detection Platform,"Illegal parking is a critical problem in large, growing cities. Currently, the responsibility for detecting illegally parked vehicles has been left to law enforcement, which often requires manual inspection. To improve the efficiency of law enforcement for vehicle parking management, we propose a web-based analytic platform that leverages recent advancements in computer vision. This proposed platform provides an algorithm to improve the performance of detecting vehicle license plates from videos, based on an existing deep learning approach. Also, we provide a method to estimate vehicle parking locations. This platform is applicable for videos of security patrolling. End-users can define restricted zones via a map-based interface and all vehicles located in these areas can be efficiently identified once patrolling videos are received. This system is evaluated by two videos captured in real-world parking lots. The results indicate that the proposed platform can successfully identify vehicle plate numbers and estimate their parking locations to support the management of urban parking infrastructure.",05-Jul
206,Detection and recognition algorithm of illegal parking,"To overcome the shortcoming of the manual detection of illegal parking cars,a surveillance algorithm was developed to detect the illegal parking cars based on the image processing technology. A visual sensor was set at the forbidden parking region of the road to record the video sequence. An adaptive mixed Gaussian model was used to extract the background in the complicated environment. The still objects were detected by the temporal sequence feature of the pixel level. The still vehicles were recognized by the regional feature of the object level to get the illegal car parking information. The auto-alarm was realized according to the requirements from the regulation of different forbidden parking regions. The suggested algorithm was validated by the video sequence of the real traffic scenes to be effective.",

208,Multi-Vehicle Tracking Based Traffic Illegal Parking Detection,"Vehicle detection and tracking are the foundations of traffic violation punishment. The current methods have more parameters to be adjusted and can not adapt to the complex traffic scenes. For the purpose of practice application, we propose an illegal parking detection algorithm based on vehicle tracking theory. In order to filter the dynamic interferences such as vehicles parking for a long time, moving vehicles overlapping, and the vehicle losing momentarily from the video, a Gaussian mixture model is combined with the correlations among adjacent pixels to update background and eliminate noises. In allusion to complex traffic scenes, a fast multi-object tracking algorithm is presented to track occluded vehicles effectively. This method predicts vehicle trajectory by Kalman filter and achieves real-time object tracking state judgment by using the feature matching matrix. The experimental results show that this method can track multiple moving vehicles effectively and has high detection precision for illegal parking incidents.",05-Jul

Lots of target detection algorithms exist including feature + classifier method,video background subtraction method,and the deep-learning method. These methods are mostly concerned about the position and confirmation of license plates and traffic signs. According to this,a method based on object interaction model to detect illegally parking event is proposed in this paper: Firstly license plate is detected based on contour extraction and SVM; secondly the traffic sign is detected based on the shape and color; the last part judges whether illegal parking exists based on object interaction model.The above-mentioned method is regarded as a validity and reliability method by being tested in the real video scene.",

The proposed algorithm is composed of four parts. First, a vehicle detection algorithm is proposed using the improved codebook object detection algorithm to segment moving vehicles from the input sequence. Second, a preprocessing technique using the geometric characteristics of vehicles is employed to exclude non-vehicle objects. Then, the detected vehicles are tracked by an object tracker which incorporates histogram tracking method with Kalman filter. To make the tracking results more accurate, histogram tracking results are used as measurement data for Kalman filter.

212,Illegal parking road recognition based on video detection equipment,"Based on the big data collected by the video detection equipment, the network topology table of the city level video detection equipment is constructed by using the time relation and the spatial position relation of the data. By using the steepest descent method and adaptive method, the travel confidence time randomness model is constructed, which can describe whether a traveler can finish his travel time on time. It overcomes the shortcomings of the existing travel time reliability calculation model, which is difficult to combine with the actual use of video detection equipment data, then examples analysis are followed. The results show that, for the data collected by the video detection device, the travel confidence time randomness model is more accurate than the existing models.

213,Novel Discriminative Method for Illegal Parking and Abandoned Objects,"Computer vision techniques have been widely applied in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) to automatically detect abnormal events and trigger alarms. In the last few years, many abnormal traffic events, such as illegal parking, abandoned objects, speeding, and overloading, have occurred on the highway, threatening traffic safety. In order to distinguish illegal parking and abandoned object events, we propose an effective method to classify these types of abnormal objects. First, abnormal areas are detected by feature point extraction and matching. The transformation relation, between the world and image coordinate systems, is then established by camera calibration. Next, different-height inverse projection planes (IPPs) are built to obtain the inverse projection maps (IPMs). Finally, the 3D information describing the abnormal objects is estimated and used to distinguish illegally parked vehicles and abandoned objects. Experimental results from traffic image sequences show that this method is effective in distinguishing illegal parking and abandoned objects, while its low computational cost satisfies the real-time requirements; furthermore, it can be used in vehicle classification.",2018
214,AN INTEGRATED TRAFFIC MICROSIMULATION MODEL OF ILLEGAL ON-STREET PARKING IN DOWNTOWN TORONTO,"On-street parking involves the blockage of the lane on which a vehicle parks, thus reducing its capacity. As 3 a result, large cities such as the city of Toronto restrict on-street parking on main routes during traffic peak 4 periods. As with any parking restriction, the compliance rate to this policy is not a 100%. This study aims to 5 use Traffic Microsimulation to quantify the impact of illegal on-street parking during the AM peak period 6 on the level of congestion in the city of Toronto. The study uses traffic demands and parking citation data 7 from the year 2011 to simulate existing traffic conditions and reflect the existing level of incompliance to 8 the on-street parking policy. Quadstone Paramics is used to incorporate the illegal parking activity into the 9 Toronto Waterfront Network simulation model. Link delay, travel time, speed and link flow along links 10 affected by illegal parking are the measures of effectiveness that reflect the implications of illegal parking in 11 the study. The base case where no illegal parking is simulated is compared with simulations incorporating 12 illegal parking to derive the difference in travel times resulting from illegal parking.

215,Deep Learning-Based Parking Detection System Using Structural Similarity,"High latency of existing vision-based parking detection systems causes significant delay in parking information delivery. The lack of access to real-time outdoor parking information induces the difficulty of finding parking and identifying parking violations, especially in busy downtown areas. Given such backdrop, this research project put forward a deep learning-based parking detection system that accurately detects parking occupancy status and illegal parking on real time basis. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier running on a single board computer is used to classify the occupancy status of parking spaces and identify the presence of illegally parked vehicles. A novel structural similarity (SSIM) decision scheme is introduced to minimize the latency of detecting parking occupancy changes. Multithreading technique is also employed to fully exploit the processing power of single board computer for accelerating illegal parking detection process. The detection results are stored at a cloud-hosted NoSQL database. Two smartphone applications namely Driver App and Enforcer App are developed to channel live parking information for assisting drivers in finding parking and supporting efficient parking enforcement respectively. The proposed parking detection mechanism is implemented and tested at the staff parking area (monitored with an IP camera) of Faculty of Engineering in Multimedia University. Experimental results demonstrated a high accuracy of over 99% in parking occupancy detection and 98.7% precision rate in locating illegal parking incidents with no missed detection under different weather conditions. The implementation of SSIM decision scheme in detecting a single instance of parking occupancy change, managed to accelerate the parking occupancy detection by up to six times faster when compared to a pure CNN classification approach. On the other hand, the incorporation of multithreading mechanism on single board computer increases the computation speed of illegal parking detection in three illegal parking regions by 2.3 times in comparison with sequential execution.",2019
216,A Robust Parking Detection Algorithm Against Electric Railway Magnetic Field Interference,"Wireless magnetic sensor networks (WMSNs) offer an effective and efficient low-cost alternative for real-time parking space monitoring. Current algorithms used for parking space detection based on the WMSNs have been well studied but not without eliminating the geomagnetic field interference. Electric railway systems, such as subways and light rail systems, produce magnetic field radiation that interferes with the geomagnetic field. The electric railway magnetic field interference has increased and is prominent in urban settings; therefore, it is imperative to filter out the interference in order to increase the detection accuracy. This paper proposes an algorithm for parking space detection, which can effectively eliminate the geomagnetic background interference. We solve the parking detection problem through signal filtering technology. Based on mathematical morphology, we designed two filters for extracting morphological structures from interfered magnetic signals. The experimental results verify that the proposed algorithm is more accurate than the existing algorithms.",2020

It is a top priority for reducing cost, to develop a detection system of those vehicles. We address a spatio-temporal volume and two types of slice surfaces from the volume, and introduce two-types of panoramic street-images, which possibly provide useful information for our daily life. We propose two alternative detection methods, using a laser-range finder and a line-scan camera. In the former detection method, EPI analysis is applied to line-scan images. As a result of verification experiments in real roads, a detection rate reached 76.9%. In the latter detection method, two kinds of cluster analysis are applied to range points: one is for clustering points at each scan, and the other for clustering points over several scans. Each cluster of range points means a vehicle. As a result of verification experiments in real roads, a detection rate reached 90%.",2013
218,Crowdsensing Maps of On-street Parking Spaces,"It has been estimated that traffic congestion costs the world economy hundreds of billions of dollars each year, increases pollution, and has a negative impact on the overall quality of life in metropolitan areas. A significant part of congestion in urban areas is due to vehicles searching for on-street parking. Detailed and accurate on-street parking maps can help drivers easily locate areas with large numbers of legal parking spaces and thus relieve congestion. In this paper, we address the problem of mapping street parking spaces using vehicles' preinstalled parking sensors. In particular, we focus on identifying legal parking spaces from crowdsourced data, whereas earlier work has largely assumed that such maps of legal spaces are given. We demonstrate that crowdsensing data from vehicle parking sensors can be used to classify on-street areas into legal/illegal parking spaces. Based on more than 2 million data points collected in Highland Park, NJ and downtown Brooklyn, NY areas, we show that on-street parking maps can be estimated with an accuracy of ~90% using proposed weighted occupancy rate thresholding algorithm.",2013

Attribute grammars can describe constraints on features (attributes) in addition to the syntactic structure of the input. Events are recognized using an extension of the Earley parser that handles attributes and concurrent event threads. Abnormal events are detected when the input does not follow syntax of the grammar or the attributes do not satisfy the constraints in the attribute grammar to some degree. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for the task of recognizing normal events and detecting anomalies in a parking lot.,2006

228,Vehicle Detection Even in Poor Visibility Conditions Using Infrared Thermal Images and Its Application to Road Traffic Flow Monitoring,"We propose an algorithm for detecting vehicle positions and their movements by using thermal images obtained through an infrared thermography camera. The proposed algorithm specifies the area of moving vehicles based on the variations of pixel values, i.e. the standard deviations of pixel values along the time direction of spatio-temporal images. It also specifies vehicle positions by applying the pattern recognition algorithm which uses Haar-like features per frame of the images. Moreover, to increase the accuracy of vehicle detection, correction procedures for misrecognition of vehicles are employed. The results of our experiments show that the information about both vehicle positions and their movements can be obtained by combining those two kinds of detection, and the vehicle detection accuracy is 96.3?%. As an application of the algorithm, we also propose a method for estimating traffic flow conditions based on the results obtained by the algorithm. By use of the method for estimating traffic flow conditions, automatic traffic flow monitoring can be achieved. In addition, there is a possibility that traffic accidents, vehicle troubles, and illegal parking can be detected with the proposed method. By using the traffic information obtained from the proposed method, we also expect to realize an optimized traffic signal control around the clock even in changeable weather.",2012
229,Algorithm of Generating Adaptive Background Modeling for crackdown on Illegal Parking,"The Object tracking by real-time image analysis is one of the major concerns in computer vision and its application fields. The Object detection process of real-time images must be preceded before the object tracking process. To achieve the stable object detection performance in the exterior environment, adaptive background model generation methods are needed. The adaptive background model can accept the nature's phenomena changes and adapt the system to the changes such as light or shadow movements that are caused by changes of meridian altitudes of the sun. In this paper, we propose a robust background model generation method effective in an illegal parking auto-detection application area. We also provide a evaluation method that judges whether a moving vehicle stops or not. As the first step, an initial background model is generated. Then the differences between the initial model and the input image frame is used to trace the movement of object. The moving vehicle can be easily recognized from the object tracking process. After that, the model is updated by the background information except the moving object. These steps are repeated. The experiment results show that our background model is effective and adaptable in the variable exterior environment. The results also show our model can detect objects moving slowly. This paper includes the performance evaluation results of the proposed method on the real roads.",2008

Secondly, a method based on two backgrounds modeled by Gaussian mixture model (GMM) with different learning rate is presented. Through simple arithmetic, it is capable to segment temporarily static vehicles in the scene. This method is computational efficient and robust because of the avoidance of a series of complex operations of merging, splitting, entering, leaving, occlusion, and correspondence which are met in traditional methodology depending on object-tracking. Thirdly, shadow suppression is used to overcome the impact of vehicles' own shadow on the detection precision. Experimental results show that the technique can effectively detect illegally parked vehicles with high precision and robustness.",2009
231,Recognizing the Illegal Parking Patterns of Cars on the Road in Front of the Bus Stop Using the Support Vector Machine,"Traffic jams are a major problem in the lives of people in the capital. The occurrence of such problems is due to drivers who do not respect traffic laws, inappropriate behavior of the driver, and the cause of illegal parking at prohibited parking, resulting in the rear car unable to move further. Possible or the car must change lanes to another lane. Therefore, to reduce such problems, we have developed an illegal parking pattern recognition system for cars on the road.

234,Intelligent drone-based surveillance: application to parking lot monitoring and detection,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones are rapidly gaining popularity in the field of remote sensing for capturing images with ultra-high spatial resolution while flying at lower altitudes. Development of highlyefficient miniaturized sensors and the use of geospatial image processing techniques have been immensely helpful in growing this technology as the most sought-after and sophisticated remote sensing technique at a relatively lower cost. Parking lot occupancy detection, one of the current drone based application area, can be used for effective management of parking spaces, to reduce queues, minimize the time required to find an area, and to issue tickets in cases of parking violations. Visual information based parking lot monitoring techniques are mostly tailored for specific applications, and they lack generalization. In this paper, a UAV-assisted quick and efficient monitoring solution is proposed for real-time parking occupancy and car number plate detection. In this approach, a drone-mounted camera has been used to capture images of the parking lot under consideration. Initially, the parking lot is being mapped using drone-coordinates, and then a dynamic programming algorithm is used to determine the shortest route to cover multiple parking lots in minimum time to capture maximum number pictures solved by the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). For capturing images, an optimum location is used, such that the drone can cover the maximum area of a parking space in minimum time. Depending on the parking area under investigation, paths altitudes and gimbal angles of the drone is changed dynamically while capturing images. Then a deep neural network based parking lot occupancy monitoring system is used to determine the number of occupied and vacant spots in a parking lot. The drone captured images of each parking spot are then tested with a pre-trained model based on car and non-car images. Then the automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) algorithm is used for parking rule enforcement. Finally, experimental results are verified using a web based application that is connected with a cloud database.",2019

The system is expected to benefit all drivers and the government, and to improve safety and traffic on the roads",2017
236,Social Media Application for Illegal Parking Problem,"Illegal parking is one of the major causes of traffic congestion. Among many ways to mitigate illegal parking, a high level of direct traffic enforcement has been shown to have the strongest impact.

241,Available car parking space detection from webcam by using adaptive mixing features,"This paper presents a robust approach for detection of available car parking spaces. With low quality of video camera as webcam and dynamic change of light around the car parking, it is hard to accurately detect or recognize the cars. Moreover the proposed appearance-based approach is efficient than recognition-based approach because it do not need to learn a huge of multi-view objects. In this paper, we propose adaptive background model-based object detection with dynamic mixing features of masked-area and edge orientation histogram (EOH) density. The average variance of variance of intensity change for dynamic background model is used to change ratio of mixing features dynamically. The masked-area density is density of predefined area of a parking slot that is weighted by Gaussian mask to robust density computation and the edge orientation histogram (EOH) density is density of the EOH in the predefined area that can be used under low contrast image as night scene.

244,Proceedings of the International Academic Conference on Frontiers in Social Sciences and Management Innovation,"In recent years, urban management is gradually developing towards informationization. There are corresponding processing mechanisms for illegal billboards and illegal parking in urban management, but the method of detecting illegal billboards based on machine vision is still under study. At present, the automatic detection method of illegal billboards based on machine vision is generally carried out under ideal conditions, and the experiment is carried out under a simple background. This paper takes a street in Hebei Province as the research object, and studies the illegal billboard area under natural conditions, and proposes to use the machine vision-based method to automatically detect the illegal billboards. In the surveillance image, according to the street scene detected by the computer. Image information enables status evaluation of billboard placement. The detection algorithm of this paper uses the multi-angle suggestion area to accurately locate the illegal billboards in the image, and mark the detected billboards. Compared with the direct detection of the billboard in the image, the interference of the background factor on the target area is removed, and the false detection rate is effectively reduced. In billboard detection, this paper proposes an improved region suggestion algorithm to generate higher quality candidate regions in an image for adapting to billboards of various poses under natural conditions. Experimental data shows that the algorithm has good adaptability to the detection of billboards in surveillance images.",2019
245,An Effective Algorithm for Video-Based Parking and Drop Event Detection,"Real-time and accurate detection of parking and dropping events on the road is important for the avoidance of traffic accidents. The existing algorithms for detection require accurate modeling of the background, and most of them use the characteristics of two-dimensional images such as area to distinguish the type of the target. However, these algorithms significantly depend on the background and are lack of accuracy on the type of distinction. Therefore, this paper proposes an algorithm for detecting parking and dropping objects that uses real three-dimensional information to distinguish the type of target. Firstly, an abnormal region is initially defined based on status change, when there is an object that did not exist before in the traffic scene. Secondly, the preliminary determination of the abnormal area is bidirectionally tracked to determine the area of parking and dropping objects, and the eight-neighbor seed filling algorithm is used to segment the parking and the dropping object area. Finally, a three-view recognition method based on inverse projection is proposed to distinguish the parking and dropping objects. The method is based on the matching of the three-dimensional structure of the vehicle body. In addition, the three-dimensional wireframe of the vehicle extracted by the back-projection can be used to match the structural model of the vehicle, and the vehicle model can be further identified. The 3D wireframe of the established vehicle is efficient and can meet the needs of real-time applications. And, based on experimental data collected in tunnels, highways, urban expressways, and rural roads, the proposed algorithm is verified. The results show that the algorithm can effectively detect the parking and dropping objects within different environment, with low miss and false detection rate.",2019
246,Applications of artificial intelligence in real-time video analytics,"Illegal parking can be a ubiquitous concern faced by urban cities, posing potential traffic impediments and safety risks to other road users. Despite having surveillance systems deployed to monitor traffic offences, the videos recorded are often stored only for post-event forensics. Manually inspecting the videos often involves repetitive human labour, which is tedious and prone to errors. In this project, a fully automated pipeline to perform end-to-end illegal parking detection with minimal or no human-in-the-loop was proposed. The pipeline first consists of vehicle detection using a deep learning based object detection algorithm, You Only Look Once Version 3 (YOLOv3), to detect vehicles. Next, movement tracking using template matching and Intersection over Union (IoU) are performed to track the time since the violating vehicle has remained stationary. The last step is to extract the license plate, using OpenALPR, of the violating vehicle which has remained stationary for a defined period. With the fully automated pipeline in place, the dataset can be intelligently leveraged and the analysis can be automated in real-time. Empirical results show high accuracy of vehicle detection and movement tracking module with the license plate detection module achieving a decent performance. However, improvements can be made by retraining its underlying license plate detection and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine with the dataset from the location which the system is to be implemented on.",2019
247,Traffic violation detection and deterrence: Implications for automatic policing,"Current efforts directed at enforcing traffic laws are beset by a dilemma. On the one hand enforcement programmes are limited in duration and intensity, thereby producing weak halo effects on drivers' behaviour. On the other hand, public attitudes towards compliance are largely conditioned by the visibility of enforcement programmes. This paper reviews the impact of the semi-automatic monitoring systems in improving detection in traffic law programmes. The effects of the technology on drivers' behaviour are assessed and implications for the development of a fully automatic traffic policing system are teased out. Secondly, the paper attempts to put into perspective any consequences that an automatic monitoring system may have for driver behaviour. The fact that such systems do not yet exist poses problems for an ergonomics evaluation of their projected impact. However, taking into account the existence of core technology, tentative conclusions can be drawn as to the likely benefits and disadvantages of such systems.",1991

250,Parked Car Detection Method Based on Home Wireless LAN -Using Household Equipment to Detect a Parked Car-,"Consumer-to-consumer (C2C) car park sharing services are now widespread. In these services, space owners rent their unused land, e.g., an unused parking space next to the owner¡¯s home, to a driver. Different from coin parking services, drivers using the park sharing services can make reservations through web sites or mobile-phone applications. There are drivers who abuse this system by, for example, overstaying their reservation. The high cost of parking space sensors that monitor the existence of a parked car makes it cost prohibitive for individuals to install these types of equipment to deter the abuse of parking spaces. To address this problem, we propose a parked car detection technique employing wireless LAN. The proposed method utilizes a household wireless LAN access point and a household laptop computer, and we monitor the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) of beacon frames. This unique method reduces the detection cost and will aid in proliferating car park sharing services. In this paper, we detect the existence of a car in a parking space using the mean and variance of the RSSI. The generated datasets are used for Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and the K-nearest neighbor algorithm (KNN) binary classification. We previously showed that a parked car can be detected when the locations of the equipment are the same. In this study, we show the effect of changing the equipment location in the house on the detection score. These results show that the best recall score is 0.88 and that changing the equipment location does not affect the recall score. The results of this study are expected to be used in a multimodal system.",2020

We propose a methodology for detecting this event in real time by applying a novel image projection that reduces the dimensionality of the data and, thus, reduces the computational complexity of the segmentation and tracking processes. After event detection, we invert the transformation to recover the original appearance of the vehicle and to allow for further processing that may require 2-D data.

The results show that, for the data collected by the video detection device, the travel confidence time randomness model is more accurate than the existing models. It can describe the probability of the traveler arriving at the destination in a given time more accurately, which can be used to identify illegal parking road and provide a reliable basis for traffic management departments in traffic planning, dividing road network status and traffic situation prediction.",2018
263,Novel Discriminative Method for Illegal Parking and Abandoned Objects,"Computer vision techniques have been widely applied in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) to automatically detect abnormal events and trigger alarms. In the last few years, many abnormal traffic events, such as illegal parking, abandoned objects, speeding, and overloading, have occurred on the highway, threatening traffic safety. In order to distinguish illegal parking and abandoned object events, we propose an effective method to classify these types of abnormal objects. First, abnormal areas are detected by feature point extraction and matching. The transformation relation, between the world and image coordinate systems, is then established by camera calibration. Next, different-height inverse projection planes (IPPs) are built to obtain the inverse projection maps (IPMs). Finally, the 3D information describing the abnormal objects is estimated and used to distinguish illegally parked vehicles and abandoned objects. Experimental results from traffic image sequences show that this method is effective in distinguishing illegal parking and abandoned objects, while its low computational cost satisfies the real-time requirements; furthermore, it can be used in vehicle classification.",2018
264,AN INTEGRATED TRAFFIC MICROSIMULATION MODEL OF ILLEGAL ON-STREET PARKING IN DOWNTOWN TORONTO,"On-street parking involves the blockage of the lane on which a vehicle parks, thus reducing its capacity. As 3 a result, large cities such as the city of Toronto restrict on-street parking on main routes during traffic peak 4 periods. As with any parking restriction, the compliance rate to this policy is not a 100%. This study aims to 5 use Traffic Microsimulation to quantify the impact of illegal on-street parking during the AM peak period 6 on the level of congestion in the city of Toronto. The study uses traffic demands and parking citation data 7 from the year 2011 to simulate existing traffic conditions and reflect the existing level of incompliance to 8 the on-street parking policy. Quadstone Paramics is used to incorporate the illegal parking activity into the 9 Toronto Waterfront Network simulation model. Link delay, travel time, speed and link flow along links 10 affected by illegal parking are the measures of effectiveness that reflect the implications of illegal parking in 11 the study. The base case where no illegal parking is simulated is compared with simulations incorporating 12 illegal parking to derive the difference in travel times resulting from illegal parking. It is observed thst on 13 average link delay increases by 50% and link flow reduces by 7% upon introducing illegal on-street parking 14 onto a link",2017
265,Deep Learning-Based Parking Detection System Using Structural Similarity,"High latency of existing vision-based parking detection systems causes significant delay in parking information delivery. The lack of access to real-time outdoor parking information induces the difficulty of finding parking and identifying parking violations, especially in busy downtown areas. Given such backdrop, this research project put forward a deep learning-based parking detection system that accurately detects parking occupancy status and illegal parking on real time basis. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier running on a single board computer is used to classify the occupancy status of parking spaces and identify the presence of illegally parked vehicles. A novel structural similarity (SSIM) decision scheme is introduced to minimize the latency of detecting parking occupancy changes. Multithreading technique is also employed to fully exploit the processing power of single board computer for accelerating illegal parking detection process. The detection results are stored at a cloud-hosted NoSQL database. Two smartphone applications namely Driver App and Enforcer App are developed to channel live parking information for assisting drivers in finding parking and supporting efficient parking enforcement respectively. The proposed parking detection mechanism is implemented and tested at the staff parking area (monitored with an IP camera) of Faculty of Engineering in Multimedia University. Experimental results demonstrated a high accuracy of over 99% in parking occupancy detection and 98.7% precision rate in locating illegal parking incidents with no missed detection under different weather conditions. The implementation of SSIM decision scheme in detecting a single instance of parking occupancy change, managed to accelerate the parking occupancy detection by up to six times faster when compared to a pure CNN classification approach. On the other hand, the incorporation of multithreading mechanism on single board computer increases the computation speed of illegal parking detection in three illegal parking regions by 2.3 times in comparison with sequential execution.",2019
266,A Robust Parking Detection Algorithm Against Electric Railway Magnetic Field Interference,"Wireless magnetic sensor networks (WMSNs) offer an effective and efficient low-cost alternative for real-time parking space monitoring. Current algorithms used for parking space detection based on the WMSNs have been well studied but not without eliminating the geomagnetic field interference. Electric railway systems, such as subways and light rail systems, produce magnetic field radiation that interferes with the geomagnetic field. The electric railway magnetic field interference has increased and is prominent in urban settings; therefore, it is imperative to filter out the interference in order to increase the detection accuracy. This paper proposes an algorithm for parking space detection, which can effectively eliminate the geomagnetic background interference. We solve the parking detection problem through signal filtering technology. Based on mathematical morphology, we designed two filters for extracting morphological structures from interfered magnetic signals. The experimental results verify that the proposed algorithm is more accurate than the existing algorithms.",2020
267,Detection of street-parking vehicles from panoramic street image,"It is important to assess street-parking vehicles causing traffic problems in urban areas, however, it is performed manually and at high cost. It is a top priority for reducing cost, to develop a detection system of those vehicles. We address a spatio-temporal volume and two types of slice surfaces from the volume, and introduce two-types of panoramic street-images, which possibly provide useful information for our daily life. We propose two alternative detection methods, using a laser-range finder and a line-scan camera. In the former detection method, EPI analysis is applied to line-scan images. As a result of verification experiments in real roads, a detection rate reached 76.9%. In the latter detection method, two kinds of cluster analysis are applied to range points: one is for clustering points at each scan, and the other for clustering points over several scans. Each cluster of range points means a vehicle. As a result of verification experiments in real roads, a detection rate reached 90%.",2013
268,Crowdsensing Maps of On-street Parking Spaces,"It has been estimated that traffic congestion costs the world economy hundreds of billions of dollars each year, increases pollution, and has a negative impact on the overall quality of life in metropolitan areas. A significant part of congestion in urban areas is due to vehicles searching for on-street parking. Detailed and accurate on-street parking maps can help drivers easily locate areas with large numbers of legal parking spaces and thus relieve congestion. In this paper, we address the problem of mapping street parking spaces using vehicles' preinstalled parking sensors. In particular, we focus on identifying legal parking spaces from crowdsourced data, whereas earlier work has largely assumed that such maps of legal spaces are given. We demonstrate that crowdsensing data from vehicle parking sensors can be used to classify on-street areas into legal/illegal parking spaces. Based on more than 2 million data points collected in Highland Park, NJ and downtown Brooklyn, NY areas, we show that on-street parking maps can be estimated with an accuracy of ~90% using proposed weighted occupancy rate thresholding algorithm.",2013
269,Attribute Grammar-Based Event Recognition and Anomaly Detection,We propose to use attribute grammars for recognizing normal events and detecting abnormal events in a video. Attribute grammars can describe constraints on features (attributes) in addition to the syntactic structure of the input. Events are recognized using an extension of the Earley parser that handles attributes and concurrent event threads. Abnormal events are detected when the input does not follow syntax of the grammar or the attributes do not satisfy the constraints in the attribute grammar to some degree. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for the task of recognizing normal events and detecting anomalies in a parking lot.,2006

Our country¡¯s law stipulates that there should be no-stop signs and markings, road sections with isolation facilities between motor vehicles and non-motor vehicle lanes and sidewalks, and crosswalks and construction sites. No parking; Railway crossings, sharp bends, narrow roads with widths less than 4 meters, bridges, steep slopes, tunnels, and sections within 50 meters of the above locations are not allowed to stop.

273,Automatic detection of long term parked cars,"The detection of illegal roadside parking is becoming more and more interesting in the field of intelligent transportation systems, since it may cause traffic congestion or accidents. In this paper we propose a method able to analyze videos acquired by traditional surveillance cameras and to automatically detect the vehicles stopped in a forbidden area. Two main contributions have been introduced: first, spatio temporal information related to the stopped vehicles are encoded by a heat map; second, the background is not updated by evaluating the movement of the vehicle in a single time instant, but instead the whole movement of the vehicles, encoded into the heat map, is taken into account. Two widely adopted datasets, namely the iLids and the PETS 2000, have been used to experimentally evaluate the proposed approach and the results achieved, compared with state of the art methodologies, confirm its effectiveness.",2015
274,Vehicle Tracking by Simultaneous Detection and Viewpoint Estimation,"We address the problem of vehicle detection and tracking for traffic monitoring in Smart City applications. We introduce a novel approach for vehicle tracking by simultaneous detection and viewpoint estimation. An Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is adapted to describe the vehicle¡¯s motion when not only the pose of the object is measured, but also its viewpoint with respect to the camera. Specifically, we enhance the motion model with observations of the vehicle viewpoint jointly extracted by the detection step. The approach is evaluated on a novel and challenging dataset with different video sequences recorded at urban environments, which is released with the paper. Our experimental validation confirms that the integration of an EKF with both detections and viewpoint estimations results beneficial.",2013

The parking control surveillance system includes a parking stop having dimensions substantially the same as traditional cement parking stops located at the rear of a parking space. The parking stop includes a video recorder for obtaining images of vehicles entering or exiting the designated parking space. The parking stop further includes a transmitter for transmitting images and information such as the time of parking transgression to vehicle enforcement personnel.,2006

Gaussian mixture model was used to collect the video sequence to realize background modeling. The background difference method was used to obtain the target foreground object and the background update method was also used to reduce the influence of environmental factors on the background model. Through the proposed target centroid method,not only the moving vehicle detection in designated area can be realized but also the illegal parking targets can be identified and alerted. Finally,the results of the experiment which have been done on a certain highway to verify the video sequence of the highway traffic scenes show that the proposed algorithm has the merits of strong scene adaptability,good efficiency and high veracity.",2014

In this area, distributed system based technology like blockchain has been standing out with its decentralization, data-innovation and data transparency. We propose a real-time non-motor vehicle violation detecting approach, which can detect and collect violation information of non-motor vehicle and has been integrated into the distributed smart traffic management system.

278,Vehicle Detection Even in Poor Visibility Conditions Using Infrared Thermal Images and Its Application to Road Traffic Flow Monitoring,"We propose an algorithm for detecting vehicle positions and their movements by using thermal images obtained through an infrared thermography camera. The proposed algorithm specifies the area of moving vehicles based on the variations of pixel values, i.e. the standard deviations of pixel values along the time direction of spatio-temporal images. It also specifies vehicle positions by applying the pattern recognition algorithm which uses Haar-like features per frame of the images. Moreover, to increase the accuracy of vehicle detection, correction procedures for misrecognition of vehicles are employed. The results of our experiments show that the information about both vehicle positions and their movements can be obtained by combining those two kinds of detection, and the vehicle detection accuracy is 96.3?%. As an application of the algorithm, we also propose a method for estimating traffic flow conditions based on the results obtained by the algorithm. By use of the method for estimating traffic flow conditions, automatic traffic flow monitoring can be achieved. In addition, there is a possibility that traffic accidents, vehicle troubles, and illegal parking can be detected with the proposed method. By using the traffic information obtained from the proposed method, we also expect to realize an optimized traffic signal control around the clock even in changeable weather.",2012
279,Algorithm of Generating Adaptive Background Modeling for crackdown on Illegal Parking,"The Object tracking by real-time image analysis is one of the major concerns in computer vision and its application fields. The Object detection process of real-time images must be preceded before the object tracking process. To achieve the stable object detection performance in the exterior environment, adaptive background model generation methods are needed. The adaptive background model can accept the nature's phenomena changes and adapt the system to the changes such as light or shadow movements that are caused by changes of meridian altitudes of the sun. In this paper, we propose a robust background model generation method effective in an illegal parking auto-detection application area. We also provide a evaluation method that judges whether a moving vehicle stops or not. As the first step, an initial background model is generated. Then the differences between the initial model and the input image frame is used to trace the movement of object. The moving vehicle can be easily recognized from the object tracking process. After that, the model is updated by the background information except the moving object. These steps are repeated. The experiment results show that our background model is effective and adaptable in the variable exterior environment. The results also show our model can detect objects moving slowly. This paper includes the performance evaluation results of the proposed method on the real roads.",2008
280,Illegally Parked Vehicles Detection Based on Omnidirectional Computer Vision,"At present, vision-based illegally parked vehicles detection faces a range of issues such as narrowness of detection range, low detection precision and robustness. This paper proposed a technique for illegally parked vehicles detection. Firstly, Omni-Directional Vision Sensors (ODVS) are used to access Omni-directional images of the scene. Secondly, a method based on two backgrounds modeled by Gaussian mixture model (GMM) with different learning rate is presented. Through simple arithmetic, it is capable to segment temporarily static vehicles in the scene. This method is computational efficient and robust because of the avoidance of a series of complex operations of merging, splitting, entering, leaving, occlusion, and correspondence which are met in traditional methodology depending on object-tracking. Thirdly, shadow suppression is used to overcome the impact of vehicles' own shadow on the detection precision. Experimental results show that the technique can effectively detect illegally parked vehicles with high precision and robustness.",2009
281,Recognizing the Illegal Parking Patterns of Cars on the Road in Front of the Bus Stop Using the Support Vector Machine,"Traffic jams are a major problem in the lives of people in the capital. The occurrence of such problems is due to drivers who do not respect traffic laws, inappropriate behavior of the driver, and the cause of illegal parking at prohibited parking, resulting in the rear car unable to move further. Possible or the car must change lanes to another lane. Therefore, to reduce such problems, we have developed an illegal parking pattern recognition system for cars on the road. We have applied the Support Vector Machine (SVM) to the signal from CCTV cameras and find important characteristics of illegal car parked at the bus stop. Then use those images to learn to recognize the parking behavior of cars with Linear Regression. From the experiment, it is found that the recognition of cars parked on the road in front of the bus stop has an accuracy rate of 82.22 percent which can be used to detect the soaking of personal cars in real life.",2019

The determination of the heights and lengths are carried out by comparing the maximum height for a set of vehicles. The system was implemented using MATLAB and the developed technique was tested for accuracy considering various classes of vehicles. For ease of implementation, the system incorporates a camera mounted on a flat surface with fixed pixel setting.",2015

284,Intelligent drone-based surveillance: application to parking lot monitoring and detection,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones are rapidly gaining popularity in the field of remote sensing for capturing images with ultra-high spatial resolution while flying at lower altitudes. Development of highlyefficient miniaturized sensors and the use of geospatial image processing techniques have been immensely helpful in growing this technology as the most sought-after and sophisticated remote sensing technique at a relatively lower cost. Parking lot occupancy detection, one of the current drone based application area, can be used for effective management of parking spaces, to reduce queues, minimize the time required to find an area, and to issue tickets in cases of parking violations. Visual information based parking lot monitoring techniques are mostly tailored for specific applications, and they lack generalization. In this paper, a UAV-assisted quick and efficient monitoring solution is proposed for real-time parking occupancy and car number plate detection. In this approach, a drone-mounted camera has been used to capture images of the parking lot under consideration. Initially, the parking lot is being mapped using drone-coordinates, and then a dynamic programming algorithm is used to determine the shortest route to cover multiple parking lots in minimum time to capture maximum number pictures solved by the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). For capturing images, an optimum location is used, such that the drone can cover the maximum area of a parking space in minimum time. Depending on the parking area under investigation, paths altitudes and gimbal angles of the drone is changed dynamically while capturing images. Then a deep neural network based parking lot occupancy monitoring system is used to determine the number of occupied and vacant spots in a parking lot. The drone captured images of each parking spot are then tested with a pre-trained model based on car and non-car images. Then the automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) algorithm is used for parking rule enforcement. Finally, experimental results are verified using a web based application that is connected with a cloud database.",2019

The system is expected to benefit all drivers and the government, and to improve safety and traffic on the roads",2017
286,Social Media Application for Illegal Parking Problem,"Illegal parking is one of the major causes of traffic congestion. Among many ways to mitigate illegal parking, a high level of direct traffic enforcement has been shown to have the strongest impact. Traffic enforcement must invest substantial human resources in patrolling and issuing parking tickets for illegally parked cards. The work load is overwhelming and efficiency is low since the illegal parking occurs almost everywhere in urban areas. This study tries to help traffic related officers ease their work load but minimize illegal parking by implementing social media networking. Social media in China has a significant number of users which covers nearly every urban area so that the service users can be public police officers to make traffic flow better in the city. The aim of this research is to develop the smartphone-based application and see its possible potential.

291,Available car parking space detection from webcam by using adaptive mixing features,"This paper presents a robust approach for detection of available car parking spaces. With low quality of video camera as webcam and dynamic change of light around the car parking, it is hard to accurately detect or recognize the cars. Moreover the proposed appearance-based approach is efficient than recognition-based approach because it do not need to learn a huge of multi-view objects. In this paper, we propose adaptive background model-based object detection with dynamic mixing features of masked-area and edge orientation histogram (EOH) density. The average variance of variance of intensity change for dynamic background model is used to change ratio of mixing features dynamically. The masked-area density is density of predefined area of a parking slot that is weighted by Gaussian mask to robust density computation and the edge orientation histogram (EOH) density is density of the EOH in the predefined area that can be used under low contrast image as night scene.

294,Proceedings of the International Academic Conference on Frontiers in Social Sciences and Management Innovation,"In recent years, urban management is gradually developing towards informationization. There are corresponding processing mechanisms for illegal billboards and illegal parking in urban management, but the method of detecting illegal billboards based on machine vision is still under study. At present, the automatic detection method of illegal billboards based on machine vision is generally carried out under ideal conditions, and the experiment is carried out under a simple background. This paper takes a street in Hebei Province as the research object, and studies the illegal billboard area under natural conditions, and proposes to use the machine vision-based method to automatically detect the illegal billboards. In the surveillance image, according to the street scene detected by the computer. Image information enables status evaluation of billboard placement. The detection algorithm of this paper uses the multi-angle suggestion area to accurately locate the illegal billboards in the image, and mark the detected billboards. Compared with the direct detection of the billboard in the image, the interference of the background factor on the target area is removed, and the false detection rate is effectively reduced. In billboard detection, this paper proposes an improved region suggestion algorithm to generate higher quality candidate regions in an image for adapting to billboards of various poses under natural conditions. Experimental data shows that the algorithm has good adaptability to the detection of billboards in surveillance images.",2019
295,An Effective Algorithm for Video-Based Parking and Drop Event Detection,"Real-time and accurate detection of parking and dropping events on the road is important for the avoidance of traffic accidents. The existing algorithms for detection require accurate modeling of the background, and most of them use the characteristics of two-dimensional images such as area to distinguish the type of the target. However, these algorithms significantly depend on the background and are lack of accuracy on the type of distinction. Therefore, this paper proposes an algorithm for detecting parking and dropping objects that uses real three-dimensional information to distinguish the type of target. Firstly, an abnormal region is initially defined based on status change, when there is an object that did not exist before in the traffic scene. Secondly, the preliminary determination of the abnormal area is bidirectionally tracked to determine the area of parking and dropping objects, and the eight-neighbor seed filling algorithm is used to segment the parking and the dropping object area. Finally, a three-view recognition method based on inverse projection is proposed to distinguish the parking and dropping objects. The method is based on the matching of the three-dimensional structure of the vehicle body. In addition, the three-dimensional wireframe of the vehicle extracted by the back-projection can be used to match the structural model of the vehicle, and the vehicle model can be further identified. The 3D wireframe of the established vehicle is efficient and can meet the needs of real-time applications. And, based on experimental data collected in tunnels, highways, urban expressways, and rural roads, the proposed algorithm is verified. The results show that the algorithm can effectively detect the parking and dropping objects within different environment, with low miss and false detection rate.",2019
296,Applications of artificial intelligence in real-time video analytics,"Illegal parking can be a ubiquitous concern faced by urban cities, posing potential traffic impediments and safety risks to other road users. Despite having surveillance systems deployed to monitor traffic offences, the videos recorded are often stored only for post-event forensics. Manually inspecting the videos often involves repetitive human labour, which is tedious and prone to errors. In this project, a fully automated pipeline to perform end-to-end illegal parking detection with minimal or no human-in-the-loop was proposed. The pipeline first consists of vehicle detection using a deep learning based object detection algorithm, You Only Look Once Version 3 (YOLOv3), to detect vehicles. Next, movement tracking using template matching and Intersection over Union (IoU) are performed to track the time since the violating vehicle has remained stationary. The last step is to extract the license plate, using OpenALPR, of the violating vehicle which has remained stationary for a defined period. With the fully automated pipeline in place, the dataset can be intelligently leveraged and the analysis can be automated in real-time. Empirical results show high accuracy of vehicle detection and movement tracking module with the license plate detection module achieving a decent performance. However, improvements can be made by retraining its underlying license plate detection and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine with the dataset from the location which the system is to be implemented on.",2019
297,Traffic violation detection and deterrence: Implications for automatic policing,"Current efforts directed at enforcing traffic laws are beset by a dilemma. On the one hand enforcement programmes are limited in duration and intensity, thereby producing weak halo effects on drivers' behaviour. On the other hand, public attitudes towards compliance are largely conditioned by the visibility of enforcement programmes. This paper reviews the impact of the semi-automatic monitoring systems in improving detection in traffic law programmes. The effects of the technology on drivers' behaviour are assessed and implications for the development of a fully automatic traffic policing system are teased out. Secondly, the paper attempts to put into perspective any consequences that an automatic monitoring system may have for driver behaviour. The fact that such systems do not yet exist poses problems for an ergonomics evaluation of their projected impact. However, taking into account the existence of core technology, tentative conclusions can be drawn as to the likely benefits and disadvantages of such systems.",1991
298,Real Time Motion Detection for Traffic Analysis Using Computer Vision,"Nowadays, as the digital era proliferates, there are a number of traffic violation detection systems built using hardware and software to detect violation of traffic rules. This article proposes an integrated method for traffic analysis by detecting vehicles in the video and tracking their motion for multiple violation detection. The purpose of this integrated system is to provide a method to identify different types of traffic violations and to reduce the number of systems used to record violations. This method receives input from traffic surveillance camera and uses DNN to classify the vehicles to reduce the number of personnel needed to do this manually. The authors have implemented modules which are used to track vehicles and detect violations such as line crossing, lane changing, signal jumping, over-speeding and find illegally parked vehicles. The main purpose of this project is to convert manual traffic analysis into a smart traffic management system.",2020
299,Illegally Parked Vehicle Detection using Deep Learning and Key-point Tracking,"In this paper, we present a method for identifying and tracking illegally parked vehicles. This approach is based on deep learning for vehicles detection and hand crafted descriptors for the tracking which are designed to cope with occlusions. The tracking of the parked vehicle is achieved by key-point extraction of the detected vehicles and feature point matching. For each frame, a bounding box was generated to represent the vehicle and feature points extracted in that area. All parked vehicles have a unique ID which was generated by the Hungarian algorithm and Kalman filter, and the parked vehicle with the same ID was matched frame by frame. Based on this matching result, the stationary vehicles in the forbidden area can be tracked. Our approach tested efficiency and robustness on a public database and is shown to produce state of the art results.",2019
300,Parked Car Detection Method Based on Home Wireless LAN -Using Household Equipment to Detect a Parked Car-,"Consumer-to-consumer (C2C) car park sharing services are now widespread. In these services, space owners rent their unused land, e.g., an unused parking space next to the owner¡¯s home, to a driver. Different from coin parking services, drivers using the park sharing services can make reservations through web sites or mobile-phone applications. There are drivers who abuse this system by, for example, overstaying their reservation. The high cost of parking space sensors that monitor the existence of a parked car makes it cost prohibitive for individuals to install these types of equipment to deter the abuse of parking spaces. To address this problem, we propose a parked car detection technique employing wireless LAN. The proposed method utilizes a household wireless LAN access point and a household laptop computer, and we monitor the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) of beacon frames. This unique method reduces the detection cost and will aid in proliferating car park sharing services. In this paper, we detect the existence of a car in a parking space using the mean and variance of the RSSI. The generated datasets are used for Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and the K-nearest neighbor algorithm (KNN) binary classification. We previously showed that a parked car can be detected when the locations of the equipment are the same. In this study, we show the effect of changing the equipment location in the house on the detection score. These results show that the best recall score is 0.88 and that changing the equipment location does not affect the recall score. The results of this study are expected to be used in a multimodal system.",2020
